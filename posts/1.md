For my last day project, [Collegememes](http://collegememes.herokuapp.com/), I needed cron and delayed_job functionality. Basically, my app, which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/nambrot/Campusmemes) by the way, fetches the memes from their respective Facebook groups' walls and feed them to the database. Since I didn't wanted to pay money for an extra worker or cron functionality to keep the memes up-to-date, I initially just thought of using either [cron.io](http://cron.io/) or just manually updating the database via HTTP-authenticated GET requests (/admin/update). However, I remember reading about introducing more concurrency to a Heroku dyno [here](http://michaelvanrooijen.com/articles/2011/06/01-more-concurrency-on-a-single-heroku-dyno-with-the-new-celadon-cedar-stack/), and I ended up doing the following:

Using the [Unicorn](https://github.com/defunkt/unicorn) gem, it not only allows me to spawn more than one web worker per dyno, but also spawn a job worker and clockwork worker, as specified in this config file:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1842737.js"> </script>
Now that I look at it, I could probably get away without the job worker, which was necessary for the manual updates.

The [clockwork](https://github.com/tomykaira/clockwork) gem takes care of the cron functionality:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1842743.js?file=clock.rb"></script>

Voila, with just two small changes, we mutated a single worker Heroku Dyno to a complex web application with cron and delayed_job functionality.
