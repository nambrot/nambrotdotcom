  title: Facebook Photo Browser - a prototype
  summary: For a couple weeks, I have been working on an idea that I hope will develop
    into something greater in the next months. While that idea involved mainly theoretical
    and operational issues, I wanted to keep my practical skills inline and since
    I have been reading a lot about web applications and especially Backbone.js, I
    decided to just play around with it. I ended up writing a small prototype for
    a Facebook Photo Browser based on the Graph API.

  title: How to disagree with your partner
  summary: Over the course of [Credport](https://www.credport.org) (which is nearly
    a year now), I have made some very invaulable experiences in terms of disagreeing
    with your partner that I'd like to share for people who may be in the similar
    situation.

  title: Anatomy of an About Page Redesign
  summary: "It's this time of the year again. Every once in a while comes that twitch,
    that realization that maybe, I should redo my website. Said and done, you are
    looking at the fourth revision of it. It all started with a [Wordpress Blog](http://mapsoffline.wordpress.com/)
    for [Maps Offline](/mapsoffline), then a Joomla CMS for [Nam's Remote](/namsremote),
    then an iWeb site, then a basic Rails site and now hopefully a slightly more polished
    version. Back then, I also had very modest site titles such as \"Nambrot.com -
    Showcase of Incredibility\".\r\n\r\nI wanted to take this opportunity and talk
    a bit about how I have approached this redesign."

  summary: If you have read my [last post](http://nambrot.com/posts/5-finding-your-passion-is-supposed-to-be-easy),
    you know that I'm on a mission to address my fears of regret and failure. The
    game plan is to trust and do. So why on earth do I think college would be a good
    place to do so?

  title: Running an Intro to Web Development
  summary: For quite some time now, I have seen people become more and more interested
    in startups and buildings products. There are many reasons why startups are becoming
    hip but I believe a fundemental one is the sheer reduction in resources needed
    to get something out of the door. I attribute a lot of my experience to the fact
    that I stumbled upon the powerful combination of Ruby on Rails and Heroku, so
    I decided to give back and give people the opportunity to be enlightened as well
    :)

    so I figured I give some sort of status update. While things are not 100% set
    and obvious yet, I feel a sense of clarity and comfort that I haven't felt in
    a while. I'd like to share what led to this.\r\n"

  summary: This is a companion post to our [Tale of Credport post](http://nambrot.com/posts/13-the-tale-of-credport/)
    in which I will go into further detail about the technical problems we had and
    decisions we made. You probably want to read that one before this one. Credport’s
    evolution in technical design on both the front-end and the back-end effectively
    coincided with our evolution from Boston/Webcred to Berlin/Credport.

  title: Finding Cheap Flights - When Place matters
  summary: Whatever people are willing to pay for, Airlines try to extract as much
    revenue from that as possible. One way to do it is to account for variable demand
    by place of booking, departure and arrival. Let’s see how you can reduce your
    airfare by optimizing all three

  title: Find_each with custom ordering in Rails
  summary: "In a recent project of mine I had to implement an activity feed. I have
    been meaning to try out the proposed solution by [GiveGab](http://blog.givegab.com/post/75043413459/using-enumerations-to-make-a-faster-activity-feed-in)
    which was a response to [ThoughtBot's approach](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/using-polymorphism-to-make-a-better-activity-feed-in-rails).
    I especially liked GiveGab's elegant solution to address the issues ThoughtBot
    had with the fan out on read approach by using Enumerations with find_each_in_batches
    in the background to do the heavy-lifting in the database.\r\n"

  summary: I just wanted to start a chrome extension and figured I should check out
    what all the hype with the frontend tooling scene is all about. The ecosystem
    looks pretty amazing, however, it seemed like there wasn't a lot of content out
    there on how to make the chrome-extension work with require-js for modular JS,
    so I figured i'd write it down here.

    the optimal lifestyle for me and how I thought more people might want to consider
    such lifestyle. As per usual, I've been learning a lot, thus been readjusting
    what the optimal lifestyle means to me. Some of those learnings I want to share
    here.\r\n"

  title: Auto-generated API documentation
  summary: Let's face it, you are probably not documenting as much as you should.
    However, code is read a lot more than it is written. We often think about the
    computer executing the code, but how often do you think about your fellow co-workers/co-programmers
    when writing your code?
