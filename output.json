Basically, my app, which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/nambrot/Campusmemes) by the way, fetches the memes from their respective Facebook groups' walls and feed them to the database. Since I didn't wanted to pay money for an extra worker or cron functionality to keep the memes up-to-date, I initially just thought of using either [cron.io](http://cron.io/) or just manually updating the database via HTTP-authenticated GET requests (/admin/update). However, I remember reading about introducing more concurrency to a Heroku dyno [here](http://michaelvanrooijen.com/articles/2011/06/01-more-concurrency-on-a-single-heroku-dyno-with-the-new-celadon-cedar-stack/), and I ended up doing the following:\r\n\r\nUsing the [Unicorn](https://github.com/defunkt/unicorn) gem, it not only allows me to spawn more than one web worker per dyno, but also spawn a job worker and clockwork worker, as specified in this config file:\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/1842737.js\"\u003e \u003c/script\u003e\r\nNow that I look at it, I could probably get away without the job worker, which was necessary for the manual updates.\r\n\r\nThe [clockwork](https://github.com/tomykaira/clockwork) gem takes care of the cron functionality:\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/1842743.js?file=clock.rb\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\nVoila, with just two small changes, we mutated a single worker Heroku Dyno to a complex web application with cron and delayed_job functionality."},{"id":2,"title":"Facebook Photo Browser - a prototype","summary":"For a couple weeks, I have been working on an idea that I hope will develop into something greater in the next months.

While that idea involved mainly theoretical and operational issues, I wanted to keep my practical skills inline and since I have been reading a lot about web applications and especially Backbone.js, I decided to just play around with it. I ended up writing a small prototype for a Facebook Photo Browser based on the Graph API.\r\n\r\nWhile the browser is not even close to something that has production value, I did learn a lot about Backbone and web applications, so I thought I might just publish the code and offer some explanation, in case it could help someone. I always love to read blogposts like this, because it offers insights in what the programmer thought of. There is more to programming than just the lines of code. The code is on [Github](https://github.com/nambrot/Facebook-Photo-Browser) and the demo runs [here](http://fbphotobrowser.herokuapp.com/).\r\n\r\n### Excuses\r\n\r\nI should probably start and excuse myself for the poor structure and documentation of the code. In a lot of ways, this is typical chaotic spaghetti-code. Although I tried to have some architecture to it so that it can be extended later, especially in the later stages of the prototype, it becomes evident that careful planning and enduring discipline is needed to create great web applications.\r\n\r\n###Features\r\n\r\nThe web application is your typical one-page page web app. The idea behind it was to think of alternative interfaces for Facebook's rich data. Therefore I got rid of all other distracting information, no page reloads, ajaxified, fluent navigation. I also implemented a rest-style history, so that you can go back to any pointer and the state is preserved.\r\n\r\n###Overview of the Software stack\r\n\r\nThe software stack of the application is relatively simple: Node.js on the backend, Backbone.js/jQuery on the frontend. With Node.js, I use node-static to simply serve our files statically. For production use, something more like connect would probably better to have gzip compression, or just move it to a CDN completely since we just have static files. I also recommend using Heroku for deployment. With the new Cedar stack, it is dead easy and fast to deploy a Node.js application for free. The backend is just this code:\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/1567200.js?file=gistfile1.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Frontend Architecture\r\n\r\nWhile the code itself is sparsely commented, I will try to explain some of the rationale behind the prototype. First, I decided to have a small loading screen to init the Facebook SDK. The logic is in the bootstrapping object in /public/app.js:\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/1567221.js\"\u003e \u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\nWe then load the Facebook SDK asynchronously and bind the proper events to detect a login. Once we successfully logged in, we remove the splash screen, create our app object and start the history object. The application itself is divided into a toolbar to display loading messages as well as providing links to the users newsfeed and profile. The presentation of the photos is divided into what I called mainpane, which holds collections of items and a viewer which displays a single item. I always ended up implementing a fullscreen view.\r\n\r\nThose higher-level objects have a addModel function that takes an object and tries to properly display it based on eitheir the main objects modelmap, or the view that is attached to the model in case of mainpane models. It would have been probably more Backbone-style, if I had implemented that with events.\r\n\r\n###Example flow of the Application\r\nAfter the Application initialized, Backbone handles the routing. So our default route is to load the newsfeed:\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/1567352.js\"\u003e \u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\nWe create a new instance of the Feed model, bind some events to show the loading of the model, initiate the fetching of the object and add it to our mainpane. We also add null to the viewer to ensure that the mainpane has the full screen estate.\r\n\r\n###Add a model to the Mainpane\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/1567385.js\"\u003e \u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\nAgain, this code is pretty simple: Remove the previous model's view, set the new model, and create a new view and append it to the mainpane's element.\r\n\r\n###Fetching Objects from the Graph API\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about Backbone is that it forces you to think in structural reusable patterns. Since Facebook's Graph API is not strictly RESTful, we have to modify the sync and parse functions of the Feed Object. The sync function is in charge of doing the actual call to the API:\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/1567438.js\"\u003e \u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\nSince Facebook again does not do it the RESTful way, we also have to modify the parse function to parse our response:\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/1567460.js\"\u003e \u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\n### Displaying a Collection\r\n\r\nThe collection view that we appended to the mainpane earlier listens for \"add\" events of the Feed Collection to add items to the view:\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/1567480.js\"\u003e \u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\nI use jQuery Masonry to display individual items since it is very flexible with resizing, so we have to update it every time we insert a new item.\r\n\r\n###Displaying a single item\r\n\r\nWe can trigger the display of single item like this: We add the Photo model to the viewer, create a point in the history, and save the state of the application.\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/1567510.js\"\u003e \u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\nThe viewer handles the model, based on its current state to display it:\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/1567546.js\"\u003e \u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\nThere are more aspects to this application, but unfortunately, I have not enough time to follow up to this prototype. If there is enough demand, I might elaborate on the other aspects.\r\n\r\n"},{"id":3,"title":"How to disagree with your partner","summary":"Over the course of [Credport](https://www.credport.org) (which is nearly a year now), I have made some very invaulable experiences in terms of disagreeing with your partner that I'd like to share for people who may be in the similar situation.","tags":["Personal","Startups"],"created_at":"2013-08-12T14:59:21.739Z","body":"\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/gjIK3qJ.jpg?1)\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the course of [Credport](https://www.credport.org) (which is nearly a year now), I have made some very invaulable experiences in terms of disagreeing with your partner that I'd like to share for people who may be in the similar situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Everyone is different\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I think it is very important to realize that everyone is different and so are we. Connor and I have been roommates for two years and have likely spent 90% of the last nearly three years together. In fact, we are currently sharing the same bed (talking about Lean Startup right there). In my opinion, we have developed an incredible understanding of each other, despite our large philosophical differences. It is that ability that has allowed us to still have these hour-long discussions about the world without hating each other. In fact this post is a result of one of these discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## You will disagree\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no way around it, you will be arguing. There are so many decisions to be made, especially at a startup, an early-stage company whose purpose (or scalable business model in lean speak) has yet to be found. Everyone wants to know everything, everyone wants to be right. I mean really, who doesn't? We are both very competitive people, we wouldn't be here if we weren't. And I know it sounds conceited, but we also have a history of being right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## You will have to admit that you can be wrong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that's the hardest thing. In order for you to respect (and retreat to) someone else's opinion you disagree with, you have to de-facto believe (or accept)  that you are not right. You will have to admit to yourself that you could be wrong. It seems very obvious now, but it's a lesson that cannot be learned unless you have been through this yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSure, there are plenty of cases, where in hindsight one of your decisions prove to be wrong, but when it involves another party, the whole game changes. Your decisions are not anymore only affecting you, and nor are you the solely responsible for your fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr to say it blunt: You share responsibility for each other. You are in this together. You are in the same bed (in our case literally).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What it takes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna lie, this has been a new situation for me. [Credport](https://www.credport.org) is the first company I have co-founded and actually the first complex project I have been doing not solely by myself. In the past I have been modestly successful with being on my own and do my own thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat being said, having a joint venture requires you to fully trust your partner. You have to realize that you both share the same goal, you both want your company to succeed. You have to realize that disagreement is not personal. Some people are naturally good at it, some aren't. I admit that it has not been my strong suit. As said, I like to be right. This ability has to be learned, trained and continuously improved. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow even with the best intentions and behaviors, its not always puppies and kittens. There will be critical decisions to be made on which you disagree. One way we reduce a lot of friction and avoid unnecessary long discussions, is to resort to our responsibility areas. If it's a question about business, Connor has the last word, if it's a product question, I do. It always has to be clear who gets to call the shots in case of disagreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why all this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt maybe sounds obvious, but I wouldn't be in this awesome situation if it weren't for Connor. Endeavors like these can simply not be done along. Plus it's one hell of a lot more exciting and fun to have a wingman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, if you read this again, you'll see that this could have been perfectly written for relationship counseling, because running a business is a lot like a marriage. Hell, even the US congress could learn a lesson or two when it comes to respectfully disagreeing, do we really need to think that the other party wants deliberately destroy America?"},{"id":4,"title":"Anatomy of an About Page Redesign","summary":"It's this time of the year again.

Back then, I also had very modest site titles such as \"Nambrot.com - Showcase of Incredibility\".\r\n\r\nI wanted to take this opportunity and talk a bit about how I have approached this redesign.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\n\r\nThe very obvious purpose of a personal website lies in self-expression. While we nowadays have a lot of tools that allow us to express in various forms and shapes, I have always viewed a personal website as something very unique, truly mine. Whereas other services have often very clear rules of what you can do, only sky is the limit when it comes to your own baby.\r\n\r\nAs I'm going through my early 20's, self-discovery and self-definition is a major plotline in my life. My website needed to reflect that. I wanted to let people where I'm coming from and how I am viewing myself. I have thought and learned a lot about it at [Credport](http://www.credport.org) with designing profiles to make people as trustworthy as possible by building a sense of familiarity.\r\n\r\nI have concluded that an ideal about page/personal profile needed to be a mixture of the emotions of an autobiography combined with the brevity of a CV and craft of an online portfolio. Every single medium hat compromises I didn't like, but together it might work.\r\n\r\n## Complexity\r\n\r\nI knew if I wanted  to succeed, I needed to manage the classical trade-off between overview vs. detail. I wanted the readers to get to know me as best as possible, yet without making them wade through a boat load of (potentially) irrelevant information. It is important to keep overall complexity low, while keeping highly contextual depth when desired. At [Apture](http://www.apture.com), I learned to love contextuality on demand, fueling curiosity and digging deeper. You just have to give users the tools to do so.\r\n\r\nThere are three complexity layers when it comes to personal information and here's how I have approached them:\r\n\r\n### Importance of a particular data point\r\n\r\nPersonal data points have variable importance. Where I went to college is usually a lot more important I went to high school. A simple slider allows the time-pressured head hunter to get a quick glance, while the stalker can take all his time to learn every little nuance about me.\r\n\r\n### Relevance of a particular data point to a reader\r\n\r\nThen again, if someone is interested in my travels or photgraphy, he couldn't care less about my latest github project. We as social beings belong to different social circles and have different facets to our personality. A couple of check boxes give the reader the ability to pick and choose.\r\n\r\n### Information complexity of that particular data point\r\n\r\nFinally, there is the inherent complexity of a data point. Sometimes you just want to get a tl;dr, sometimes you wanna know it all. For sufficiently complext data points, you can break out a lightbox for more depth or show the photo gallery inline.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nOnce I had the plan, implementation was relatively straightforward. The about page effectively consists of a lost of entries like these:\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/nambrot/6252713.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\nOn load, the jQuery plugin parses these entries for their category tags as well as their importance. Whenever any of the variables change, I reflow the collection. When an entry is 'flippable', I apply some fancy schmancy CSS Transform for that card-flipping effect. I actually had to hack around a bit, as the back-flipping causes webkit to stop anti-aliase, so what you actually see is double-sized elements that get a scale(0.5) smashed onto them.\r\n\r\nI have actually planned to refactor this \"timelinify\" jQuery plugin, but at this point it makes too many assumption in order to be useful to anyone. Maybe I will refactor it some more in the future, in the mean time you can check it out on [Github](https://github.com/nambrot/nambrotdotcom/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/timelinify.js.coffee)\r\n\r\nWhat actually made it out is the \"gallery\" gem I have written to supply my photos (gotta find some time for some minimal documentation though). It uses omniauth to fetch my albums from Google+ and then serves them via a mountable engine. The horizontal scroll design is heavily inspired by [portfoliojs](https://github.com/abhiomkar/portfoliojs). I have modified it to take multiple galleries per page, as well as \"decorate\" image tags with their respective album as you can see on some travel entries.\r\n\r\nOther notable features are the relative responsive-ness of the site as well as the off-canvas menu.\r\n\r\n## Done.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly satisfied with the current iteration and hope i will last for a while. I would love to hear your opinion and feedback though. What I noticed during the implementation is that cross-browser development is still a pain in the ass. Also, I'm definitely a perfectionist when it comes thinking about every possible edge case, but incredibly lazy to finish the last 5%. There are so many minor annoyances that I have simply given up. I hope you won't notice."},{"id":10,"title":"On How I Met Your Mother","summary":"With the series final still in somewhat fresh memory, I wanted to write down some words on what I can only describe as a profound emotional reaction I had last night.\r\n","tags":["Personal"],"created_at":"2014-04-01T19:08:49.868Z","body":"With the series final still in somewhat fresh memory, I wanted to write down some words on what I can only describe as a profound emotional reaction I had last night.\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv class='flex-video'\u003e\r\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/IQfqHsEifS8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\nDespite HIMYM didn't starting to air in Germany until 2008 (created in 2005), I have read great reviews of it beforehand which made me anticipate the pilot quite a lot. Back then, I already was a TV series junkie, but apart from maybe Scrubs, I don't think any other series ended up having such an deep impact on me as HIMYM did. Once I watched the pilot, I was sold and told all of my friends to watch it. Arguably, HIMYM is now far more popular in Germany than here in the US.\r\n\r\nAlthough HIMYM has always been my favorite TV show, I was surprised by the gravity of the show's finality, despite it's declining draw of the more recent seasons. It's not until something is gone that you will start to realize the significance it has had on your life, and HIMYM for sure had it.\r\n\r\nThe finale did a great job of emphasizing the strengths of the plot (despite minor shortcomings due to having to cram everything in the last episode). HIMYM was never about the story of how Ted meets the love of his life (whether that'd be the mother or Robin).\r\n\r\nHIMYM was above all a celebration of life, full of the awesomeness and legendary-ness that we want it to be. It was a glimpse of a version of what could be us. We live in a generation where boredom and averageness are our biggest fears. We want to be special. Over the nine seasons, we have witnessed a lot of legendary stories and while they might not occur in such a concentration in real life, they remind and inspire us to keep our lives interesting and full of change, enthusiastic and appreciative of the little things.\r\n\r\nEverything that happens, good or bad, is meant to be and might be important in the larger story. I'm not usually a fan of destiny, but HIMYM definitely made the idea of the universe having a plan for you far more likeable. It reaffirms our desire for karmic effects, that when bad things happen, good things will happen, that if you keep trying, you will be rewarded. In the meantime, all you can and should do is take it easy and live life to its fullest.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, like any sitcom, we had many of the same platitudes that you would get in your everyday Buzzfeed GIF list of the day but in many ways, the struggle of the character's was incredibly relatable. Whether it is Marshall and Lily's constant struggle to balance the sacrifice of their professional life with the realities of their early relationship, Robin's struggle with becoming emotionally invested, or from a males perspective, Ted's and Barney's relentless pursuit and all the stupid things they (or we) do to get married and laid. It was enough emotions to matter but not too much to become too serious.\r\n\r\nEven before I started to appreciate the significance of celebrating life, the friendship that the five shared was truly inspiring from the start. The running gags that we come to acquire, the role that each character plays in the group, all these are the extensions of our desire to have a purpose and make a mark on the world and people around us. We want to be memorable, but also share our life with people that matter to us. This all culminates in the regular gathering at McLaren's where the war stories and memories are exchanged.\r\n\r\nWhile it might never culminate in a regular alcohol session at the local bar, I really really hope that it will happen to me in one way or another. The incredibly awesome thing about long-lasting friendships are the insider jokes, the shared memories, the weird quirks and old traditions. I'll most likely adopt a more nomadic lifestyle than the average joe, so focusing on keeping and nurturing your close friendships is of paramount priority to me in order to become the person who I want to be.\r\n\r\nEven more rewarding than the lessons of the story, was the social experience of communally watching (and re-watching (and re-watching)) the episodes, discussing what happened last night in between classes and planning on how we can be as awesome as Barney. All the things that were embodied in the show, the 16-year old versions of ourselves wanted to do. While watching the finale, I wished I could have shared that experience with my friends from back home as well.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, I would have never guessed that this experience would have such a deep impact on me. And this might be the biggest takeaway for me.\r\n\r\nI used to think that society's love for pop-culture is on the same level like sensationalism in journalism or our obsession with celebrities: A \"lower\" human desire that we all seem to agree to be \"bad\" intellectually, but consider a \"guilty pleasure\".\r\n\r\nI now greatly reconsider the value of pop-culture to my individual development and ultimately recognize the strength of well-made cultural works. There always have been TV shows or movies that I drew lessons from (House, Jericho, I am Legend, I'm a sucker for semi-realistic post-apocalyptic stories), but not to the profound extent like HIMYM. I used to secretly mock and make fun of people who extrapolate their life onto pop-culture, but only now I come to realize that I was the ignorant one.\r\n\r\nShall the next generation have the luxury of having such a great piece of culture to help them grow up to the people they want to become.\r\n\r\nSome gems:\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv class='flex-video'\u003e\r\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/fmAWIDI4ZgY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv class=\"flex-video\"\u003e\r\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/TV-NhfgoA7A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv class='flex-video'\u003e\r\n\u003ciframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/6KUtPKT0wrE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e"},{"id":13,"title":"The Tale of Credport","summary":"Get ready for this 4000+ word behemoth that tells the story of Credport.

Prepare for a long post with a mix of high-level overview and deep comments.\r\n\r\n\u003e Credport started way back in the Fall of 2011 as a product of one of many philosophical discussions with Connor that generally range somewhere between meaning of life and merits of political systems.\r\n\r\nRachel Botsman’s TED talk solidified our confidence in a more decentralized economy in which traditional middle men, facilitating transactions via arbitrage, would be replaced by the technical innovations that would allow us to trust and transact with one another more efficiently.\r\n\r\nImmediately, we saw that the then (and current) affairs of trust were suboptimal and we could think of two ways to improve it: \r\n\r\n1. P2P Marketplaces were the way to go to disrupt individual verticals, yet there was no sufficient way of sharing reputation data across marketplaces in an efficient way. You reputation would be siloed in marketplaces, greatly reducing the potential reach of Collaborative Consumption.\r\n\r\n2. There was a wealth of data available in the form of social network data that would allow us to more reliably increase both the objective nature of trust in overall risk reduction, as well as the subjective nature of trust in comfort. In particular, connectivity data leverages the truly powerful friend-of-a-friend concept. Not enough marketplaces were taking true advantage, which we attributed to technical limitations.\r\n\r\nBesides these insufficiencies, we were also dreaming about the very obvious huge potentials of an implementation of the principles above:\r\n\r\n1. With low confidence in contemporary protocol design and distribution, a system like this ultimately is only feasible when designed as a central system. In consequence, if successful, a central identity system for the Internet had many other applications. We were dreaming of a world with no lock-in effects and perfect data portability. As product geeks, the possibilities seemed endless.\r\n\r\n2. A system like ours would become a very central and integral part of effectively a big chunk of economic activity. Even with minuscule margins, we would be rich as fuck.\r\n\r\nIt was hard not to get excited. It seemed like no one yet has came across that angle (I know right, how naive?). Thankfully, I have been able to work with Professor Byers to make this my Independent Project in the Spring of 2012, freeing up time from school work (which I thought was a colossal waste of time at the time). \r\n\r\n### The first Webcred Presentation\r\n\u003cscript async class=\"speakerdeck-embed\" data-id=\"2eac20a0ed63013014de22c9f26df16d\" data-ratio=\"1.2994923857868\" src=\"//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\n### The first Webcred Executive Summary: \r\n\u003ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13tg6iBW4YredKyxvEKED81pXOGL51X-jG99ntEWd-Yo/pub?embedded=true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\n## Basic Design Principles\r\n\r\nThe basic outline of such a system was very simple:\r\n\r\n1. Have a central website that ultimately holds the identity and associated data.\r\n2. Interface with relevant parties to facilitate the exchange of identity and associated data in an efficient way (read: great API).\r\n3. It should be consumer facing. We specifically wanted to avoid the situation of contemporary, in-transparent credit bureaus or online advertising trackers that effectively already consolidate your data across various systems, but generally do so against your favor. Our slogan would be: “Take advantage of what is already done and use your data in your favor”.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How do you get initial distribution for such a system?\r\n\r\nWe believed no one before has given enough priority to the above question. We knew that for distribution, we ultimately needed to satisfy two important criteria:\r\n\r\n- The inevitable complexity addition by such a system to the User Experience would need to be held to an absolute minimum.\r\n- The value-add to both the user and the marketplace, especially in the beginning without network effects, have to be clear and convincing.\r\n- To the user, it needs to significantly improve their (often non-existing) trustworthiness and effectively chances of succeeding in a transaction.\r\n- To the marketplace, the system needs to significantly increase conversion rates and trustworthiness of the marketplace itself.\r\n\r\nFor example, he hypothesized that the biggest player then, Trustcloud, had a suboptimal UX with an inconsistent signup flow. The trust increase because of the score and badges were irrelevant. Data exchange and hence trustworthiness increase were absent. Because of these issues, marketplaces were not adopting their system. In hindsight, we truly believed we improved upon these criteria, but ultimately, not aggressively enough and that didn’t end up mattering anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Webcred I\r\n\r\nThe objective behind Webcred I was to create a functional prototype that would help us articulate the somewhat unusual position of Webcred between a consumer facing profile and tightly integrated API. In the original design, we effectively build an Open Graph clone that would allow third parties to exchange data with one another, unlike the original with Facebook being the exclusive consumer of pushed data. We always thought Open Graph was incredibly clever designed and remains in my opinion one of Facebook’s most under-appreciated efforts, but only the reuse of third party data would allow a true exchange of trust and reputation data.\r\n\r\n\u003cscript async class=\"speakerdeck-embed\" data-id=\"4f7aaa40829b3f001f00ef49\" data-ratio=\"1.33333333333333\" src=\"//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\nThe [prototype](http://webcred-core.herokuapp.com/) consisted of 3 parts:\r\n\r\n### [The Core System](http://webcred-core.herokuapp.com/)\r\n\r\nThe Facebook. Holder of all data which the marketplaces would be able to fetch through OAuth.\r\n\r\n### [The Marketplace](http://webcred-airbnb.herokuapp.com/)\r\n\r\nThey would rely on us as their user account and trust system by plugging “Sign in with Webcred” just like “Sign in with Facebook”.\r\n\r\n### [Third Party Validators](http://webcred-tax-return-validator.herokuapp.com/)\r\n\r\nOur implementation of a decentralized system that allows infinite credentialing of arbitrary attributes. \r\n\r\nSome thoughts:\r\n\r\n- We were way too tied to the utopian idea of one-and-only-one-profile-everywhere concept. We very clearly overestimated the marketplace willingness to use us as as a source of profiles, it wasn’t until Credport where we realized we had to play a much more ancillary function on the marketplace. Something we could have easily figured out by just asking first.\r\n- Verified Information was a typical “if we had scale” and academic feature. Not practical at all and quickly scrapped thereafter.\r\n- We rather mistakenly focused on the exchange of data part way too much. We were thinking in Open Graph terms with Facebook scale in mind, which is now obviously very stupid.\r\n- OAuth was the best compromise in security/privacy and ease of use across platforms. I cannot recommend the doorkeeper gem enough, creating an OAuth Provider would be way harder without it.\r\n- The social connections feature was by far the most popular feature, which ultimately led us to make it our long-term emphasis by doubling down on Neo4j, the graph database.\r\n\r\n\u003ciframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/gGXUarV-f6o?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\r\n## Getting (not really) real\r\n\r\nThis is a really weird chapter to write in hindsight, but we didn’t do anything productive. We were not building a company, we were trying to spread an idea. Being super smug about people writing business plans, we didn’t really do much better either. Instead of finding and talking to customers, we spent the majority of our time polishing up the applications to YC and Summer@Highland and talking to people we knew for their feedback. We were sure that once we would have built the very obviously superior product, everything else would fall into place. SOOOO obviously never the case. Yet perhaps most weirdly, we managed to get into the highly prestigious Summer@Highland program. I think on some level, our exaggerated confidence in our product idea resonated with many people, especially in personal face-to-face communications. In hindsight, I blame a lot of our lack of focus on us successfully overselling what we had.\r\n\r\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/aRFEAAXAQTY?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\r\n## Summer@Highland: But Seriously\r\n\r\n![](http://summerathighland.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/tumblr_m7mw6govz61rvdvapo1_1280.jpg?w=1000\u0026h=)\r\n\r\nWith the financial freedom and lack of pressure to find something practical for the summer (Connor dropped his GE and I my Facebook internship), we reached an important milestone and added a lot of legitimacy through Summer@Highland. We had big plans and thought we were the prototypical startup story: Connor would stay with his girlfriend, I would stay in a triple in a MIT frat. We would be the first one to enter and last one to leave the office, or stay over night all together. We were eating way too many cup noodles and Easy Mac. I remember to wake up one morning to the sight of HCP's limited partners and Apple’s former VP of Marketing Allison Johnson on an office tour.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, SigEp, the fraternity I was staying at had a party. Let's just say I got fairly intoxicated and thought it would be a good idea to climb up the fire-escape. (it's not). A brother ended up yelling I should get down immediately, but I just took the first open window and jumped in. At the time, we were looking for some engineering help and lo and behold, the two MIT students in the room ended up helping us out for the summer.\r\n\r\nOur game plan for the summer would look a little bit like this:\r\n\r\n- Build the production ready system that we could actually sell with.\r\n- Sell. (Note how it’s not the other way round like it should be)\r\n\r\nSo while I spent any wake moment cranking out a product that we were not qualified to make, Connor compiled a list of all potential customers and reached out.\r\n\r\nLuckily, we were able to get Samir on board. He was essential while he worked in his free time next to his Microsoft internship in Seattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur distribution strategy was:\r\n\r\n\u003cimg src=\"http://summerathighland.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/tumblr_m5vetvnvmq1rvdvapo1_1280.jpg?w=700\u0026h=\" style=\"display: inline; max-width: 300px; float: left; margin-right:16px;\"\u003e\r\n1. Find small marketplaces, use them as “guinea pigs” since they don’t have a trust system anyways. We thought they were more likely to cooperate.\r\n2. Gain initial set of marketplace to launch with and add marketplaces as we go by seeding the network effect.\r\n\r\nFrom a product perspective, we spent way too much time on building with a set of features that we really couldn’t know were wanted. Although we enjoyed immersing in technologies we have not used on such a scale (Neo4j, Backbone). \r\n\r\nEspecially the “granting visibility” feature was completely and utterly irrelevant and I’m not sure why we did that. Privacy was a defensive argument we needed use to justify our centrality. I fondly remember sitting in a Venetian Las Vegas hotel room, showcasing that feature for our TechStars Seattle interview and looking into not-so impressed faces.\r\n\r\nFollowing the previous tenor, we also focused way too much on some theoretical scale and interactions with third parties, when we really had no one. We normalized everything into Neo4j, thinking that calculating shared information was crucial, when really, only connections benefit. The single worst technical decision we made is to completely rely on Neo4j for our persistence. Not that Neo4j was bad as a database, but for traditional relational data use cases, you can’t beat a mature RBMDSs like Postgres. Instead, we ended up architecting this incredibly complex hypergraph with nearly 1-to-1 parity with Facebook’s OpenGraph objects up to a point where people’s college majors would be their own node in the graph. Needless to say, managing that complexity wasted a lot of our time, writing our own ORM/persistence layer instead of just being able to use ActiveRecord. \r\n\r\nUnder the pretense of Lean Startup, we also tried to get more potential user feedback despite lacking a functional product. We admittedly scraped users on Zimride and RelayRides messaged them with a survey about trust and their experience, we did some simple blind tests on room mate searches on craigslist, as well as survey people via Amazon Mechanical Turk. In all these cases, we had very clear feedback that our product was not needed. I’m not sure why we never acted on that feedback to be honest.\r\n\r\nThough to be fair, we were also looking for alternative options, the all hailed pivots. We briefly considered going into roommate/renting or financial services where applications of increased trust seemed beneficial, but quickly decided that this is not where our interests lied.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the summer, we were still weeks away from anything usable. A lot of mockups and prototypes. Not only that, but we weren’t that successful with marketplaces either. We managed to get some interest, but as we would later learn, interest is worth nothing without commitment.\r\n\r\n\u003cscript async class=\"speakerdeck-embed\" data-id=\"2a660f90cfbc0131b2c37a72b021c15e\" data-ratio=\"1.33333333333333\" src=\"//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we were in a similar situation like before the summer: There was no one telling us to get real, stop building a product no one wants and start selling (Though we did sign one pilot agreement during the summer). Despite objective slow progress, anyone we talked to expressed enthusiasm. That enthusiasm led us to seriously think about possibly not returning to college in the fall. However, my missing student visa would have been in the way, but coincidentally, Startupbootcamp Berlin popped up, and after a hopeful Skype interview with Alex Farcet, we realized how much sense it made: Further financing (we weren’t really ready for an actual round) and mentoring (from which we benefited greatly at Highland and SBC had plenty of marketplace leaders), ability to live with my parents and Berlin being generally cheap. Within just days, we booked one-way tickets to Berlin.\r\n\r\n\u003ciframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/47236139\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\r\n## Berlin: The Next Chapter\r\n\r\n![](https://scontent-b-atl.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/t1.0-9/76860_10151061516711097_1507908011_n.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhile we were ready to make Berlin our next chapter, we weren’t quite willing to risk everything. We told ourselves that if we were not to get into Startupbootcamp, Connor would start his supposed study abroad semester in Dublin and I would return to Boston for my RA position. For me, that complicated our trip to Berlin as I only had a short window of applying to Visas and getting a flight back. In fact, I missed the first half day of the selection days due to my US visa interview as a backup (sorry Alex!).\r\n\r\nMaybe unsurprisingly, the selection days kept the same level of enthusiasm. People loved the idea and industry. We also had very encouraging talks with the marketplace people, especially with Gunnar who was the Director of Airbnb Germany at the time. After a deserved short break, it was time to get back to work.\r\n\r\nAgain in hindsight, we pretty much kept repeating the same mistakes: Kept ourselves busy with work that was ultimately irrelevant and avoided doing the tough sell. We kept saying that our product was just not ready to show to anyone, hence kept our conversations with marketplaces at an informal level. We tried to gain a voice within the Collaborative Consumption Movement, and become a thought leader when it comes to trust and reputation. Connor did most of that outreach. \r\n\r\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zPK7W3mgjOQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\r\nWe realized that the US market was already dominated by few big players like Airbnb, TaskRabbit, RelayRides and figured that the rest of the world, including Europe, would be a lot more fragmented and hence easier for us to get a foot in. We learned that despite advances in technology, physical proximity is huge when it comes to partnerships, which is why our eventual pilot partners would be all German marketplaces. \r\n\r\nFrom a product perspective, our goal was to drive adoption by marketplaces by making it easier to integrate and less obtrusive on their UX. While our previous iterations assumed a lot about marketplaces integrating with our incredibly expressive and flexible API, we eventually boiled it down to one line of code.\r\n\r\nIn the process, we ended up moving away from our overly complicated hypergraph system to a more sane relational model with parts of it persisting in Neo4j to support our fast Common Connection/Common Interests queries, while preserving our rich third party data support, where Marketplaces could push data like reviews to our system to be displayed on the users’ profiles.\r\n\r\nFrom here on out, the product wasn’t really changing much, we built on top of our three pillars: Verification (of profiles, phone numbers, email adresses), Aggregation (of reviews, work/school history) and Connections (across arbitrary networks). The goal: humanize the marketplace user profile.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Rachel Botsman’s second TED talk about trust and reputation came out, and we felt validated by our aggregation/context \u003e  scoring approach etc. \r\n\r\n\u003ciframe src=\"http://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/rachel_botsman_the_currency_of_the_new_economy_is_trust.html\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\r\nWhile we benefited greatly from SBC’s connections in the local tech scene, we did feel like there was an oversupply of people we had to meet, and we ended up wasting a lot of time talking to people who were irrelevant to us and were just there to throw in their often unqualified opinions. We were at a stage we we just needed to get shit done really. The big emphasis on Demo Day didn’t help either. Connor spend the better part of of November preparing for the 5 minutes on stage, a distraction in hindsight.\r\n\r\nUltimately, we did end up completing a usable product (it had to happen eventually) and “soft-launched” at HyBerlin:\r\n\r\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/-G3ZSQrcP-w?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following weeks, we finalized our integration with Tamyca (for which we are eternally grateful), just in time for Demo Day. Shortly thereafter, Kinderfee joined us as partners. With that light at the end of the tunnel, we gained some more confidence. During the program, I personally exhibited some burn out symptoms, so it was great to hear some good news. That wouldn’t last very long though.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Break\r\n\r\nChristmas break hit like a thunder. While we enjoyed the time off a lot (Connor went home and I traveled with friends), the emotional disconnect for two weeks was deadly. Talks with investors just prior to the break died, talks with marketplaces had to be restarted, things were just not going very well. We assumed that once we actually had marketplaces on board, getting the next one would be significantly easier due to the network effect. That was simply not the case. Turns out it is very hard to get people from the “I’m interested, this sounds very cool”-stage to the “I’m in, sign me up”-stage. \r\n\r\nEven with the marketplaces we already signed, we did not see the growth we needed. We weren’t really prominently featured in their sign-up process (which we totally understood), not enough people were signing up and worst of all, we couldn’t really produce any metrics to prove that we actually helped the marketplaces which was a critical presumption to convincing additional marketplaces. So the next weeks were all focused on improving our critical metrics. We had many little improvements, but nothing we could come up would feasibly have a big enough impact to change the game.\r\n\r\nThis is when realized the ultimate problem (rather late, but better than never): Trust just isn’t that big of an issue for marketplaces.\r\n\r\nIt seemed so antithetical to everything we’ve been working on up to this point, and that’s why it probably took us so long to get to this point. Everyone in the industry complained about how trust was a game changer, how it was so important, whole TED talks and conferences were being given for that sole topic. Everyone has read about scam stories on eBay and Craigslist. Even marketplaces said it’s important to them. However, that was only the PR game, internally, marketplaces have a lot of other things to worry about. Growth, market liquidity, user responsiveness, payments, etc. We learned about it firsthand from Gidsy, with whom we became great friends. And we needed that, because no one else was going to tell us, no one else had any incentive to be that honest with us.\r\n\r\nWeirdly, as far as the public was concerned, everything was great. Collaborative Consumption received more treatment in the media and so did we. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n![](https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/t1.0-9/312299_4742734759296_732415447_n.jpg)\r\n\r\n[Gründerszene](http://www.gruenderszene.de/allgemein/berlin-tech-meetup-6), [TAZ](http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/digitaz/artikel/?ressort=ln\u0026dig=2013%2F06%2F01%2Fa0024\u0026cHash=4baa8dcc1282b9b2b79e79ed560aead3), [Netzwertig](\r\nhttp://netzwertig.com/2013/01/09/credport-reputationsplattform-fuer-die-welt-des-kollaborativen-konsums/), [Silicon Allee](\r\nhttp://news.siliconallee.com/2012/12/14/children-of-social-media-credports-quest-for-online-trust/)\r\n\r\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/xZODovO46no?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\r\nWe even had a class at CMU talking about us, as well as a Master’s thesis use us as a case study. As confusing as it was, the question became: Are we gonna keep going?\r\n\r\n## The Inevitable\r\n\r\nObviously, we didn’t and here is why (as taken from our email we send out to our mentors and supporters shortly thereafter):\r\n\r\n### Trust is not an immediate problem \r\n\r\nWe talked to many marketplaces and heard \"yeah, trust is super important for us.\" We heard many complaints about how sketchy craigslist is. However, looking at people's behavior, trust isn't the problem for peer to peer marketplaces - it's the incentives they offer. Trust is a problem that people often talk about, but don't really act upon. We assumed that increasing trust in P2P Marketplaces would increase their conversion rates tremendously. Not only did we fail to prove that, many P2P marketplaces need to focus on growth and getting critical mass before focusing conversion rates.\r\n\r\n### Not really a market (yet)\r\n\r\nOur approach was a bet that many marketplace similar to Airbnb, but in different verticals, would spring up and grow quickly. However, it turns out that many of the collaborative consumption companies that were started didn't fare very well, and the ones that did have build their own sophisticated trust solutions. Our potential market, both in number of companies and revenue they were taking in is much smaller than we originally thought. Credport was really designed towards \"many to many\" marketplaces in the eBay style. Many of the companies doing well right now operate in a \"one to many\" style where one side has a much smaller population - Uber, Lyft, Handybook, etc.\r\n\r\n### Product vs. Competition\r\n\r\nThough not necessarily why we failed, differentiating our product did cause a major timeline setback. Other companies had already attempted to solve the same problem in the same niche (trustcloud.com) - we assumed that it was because they had the wrong product, so we spent a long time developing a significantly different product utilizing the social graph as a focus. However, potential partners were more concerned with \"why do I need a solution in the first place?\" than \"why should I pick you?\"\r\n\r\n### What's up with Collaborative Consumption?\r\n\r\nCollaborative Consumption is a serious movement, and will have some big long term implications - however we don't think that you'll be renting everything from your neighbors or strangers. Services like DriveNow (https://www.drive-now.com), which provide you access to an asset without ownership, but where the asset is managed by a company, are where we believe where most of the potential lies. That asset may be a good, or a service (handybook.com), but it will be simple and on demand. If we had to pick a phrase for this movement, it would not be the sharing economy, but the \"technology-enabled access\" economy.\r\n\r\nWe knew we were young and have, as cheesy as it sounds, a bright future ahead of us, so there was no point in trying to chase an infeasible dream. We still had our scholarships at BU and could graduate along with our friends. We enjoyed our time a lot doing Credport, but at the same time felt that we maybe tried to grow up a little bit too early.\r\n\r\n### What came after\r\n\r\nAfter the admission of failure and defeat there was a mix of two feelings: Relief that it is over and being able to close this chapter on the one hand, natural feelings of anxiety and self-doubt on the other. Luckily, we had the unconditional support of people we have met along the way, easily the best thing that happened to us with Credport. That and learning a ton and being glad that we did it. However, saying it wasn’t hard would be a lie. I won’t go into further detail here, if you are interested in my personal struggles, [read here](http://nambrot.com/posts/5-finding-your-passion-is-supposed-to-be-easy/).\r\n\r\nConnor ended up returning to Boston for the Summer, I traveled to South East Asia until I ultimately joined Connor in Boston for our senior year at Boston University.\r\n\r\nRead a bit more technical account [here](http://nambrot.com/posts/14-credport-technical-post-mortem/).

The game plan is to trust and do. So why on earth do I think college would be a good place to do so? After all, it seems like an undisputable axiom in the tech community that college is overrated, unnecessary and overpriced. It's just four years of partying and procrastination. The dropouts are celebrated like they have reached salvation. Let the messiah Steve speak:\r\n\r\n\u003e And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay. [1]\r\n\r\n(I will say that the situation may be different for me because of the substantial financial support I'm receiving.)\r\n\r\nWell, I'm here to say that I think college deserves more credit for what it can do to people that are in situations like mine:\r\n\r\n- **Light-hearted**: In my observation, more professional, mature environments tend to be quite intense. There is a lot of pressure, a lot of cynicism. Working long hours is glorified. Especially in American college, everything is taken a lot lighter, you are encouraged to explore with no immediate payoff necessary.  You are not forced to perpetually think: \"Am I being optimally efficient and effective?\".\r\n\r\n- **Procrastination**: Procrastination is not always bad. There is also the good kind of procrastination. The kind that fuels your curiosity, where you lose yourself for hours in a new topic. It's nearly essential for [creative people](https://medium.com/creative-business/8b51018ef20d)\r\n\r\n\u003eAnd much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. [1]\r\n\r\n- **Diversity**: Obviously, in any good ecosystem, you are bound to meet amazing people from different backgrounds. But let's be honest: They tend to be overwhelmingly white males from privileged backgrounds. Slightly exaggerated but you get my point. If you go to the right college, the racial, socio economic, cultural, academic diversity in all of its facets is one of the richest you will ever get to experience. \r\n\r\n- **Lack of Responsibility**: Similarly, you basically get a free pass for four years. Peter Thiel has always criticized that college allows young people to not having to think about their future for four years. I come to think that this is not necessarily a bad thing. When you have nothing on the line, only then you can truly experiment. Failure becomes demystified when you have literally nothing to lose.\r\n\r\nWhile my primary motivation for going back to college is to get a degree for easier future immigration into the US, I am incredibly excited for college. Only time will tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] [Steve Jobs' 2005 Commencement Speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc)"},{"id":7,"title":"Running an Intro to Web Development","summary":"For quite some time now, I have seen people become more and more interested in startups and buildings products.

The very declarative nature of Ruby, well-thought-out conventions and rich gem ecosystem allows you to just use examples and code snippets online and modify it to your needs. As time goes along, you'll understand how everything works (I'm not quite there yet)\r\n\r\nSo my biggest priority was to get that point across while having a great diversity in the audience. There were CS seniors with plenty of programming experience on the one side and just curious business students on the other side, finding the right balance was difficult. In the end, I settled on a quick overview of what webapps are and how Rails and other framework fit into the current landscape, followed by a 1-2 hour live-coding session that involves the cloning on reddit. I used [nitrous.io](http://www.nitrous.io) to allow the students to read the source code while I was editing it, as well as interact with the web page as we go.\r\n\r\nThe concepts covered are:\r\n\r\n- Git\r\n- Gems\r\n- rails g scaffold\r\n- Migrations\r\n- MVC Convention\r\n- Validations\r\n- Deploy to Heroku (\u003c3)\r\nYou can find the slides below and the github repo [here](https://github.com/nambrot/reddit).\r\n\r\n\u003cscript async class=\"speakerdeck-embed\" data-id=\"238156d02dee01314fea1633b5b947f7\" data-ratio=\"1.33333333333333\" src=\"//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e"},{"id":18,"title":"My crazy SF story","summary":"San Francisco has always something exciting to offer.","tags":[],"created_at":"2014-11-25T02:04:20.724Z","body":"After some exhaustive, but ultimately successful weekend at PayPal's BattleHack, we (Connor, Connor and I) took some days off to chil, enjoy the nice SF weather and some sightseeing. On our second to last day, we toured the Marina, the Presidio, the Golden Gate Bridge and Lombard Street. We were meeting a friend later at the Eventbrite offices, so we decided to bridge the time at a small pastry shop called [Victoria Pastry Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/victoria-pastry-company-san-francisco-2). We were sitting outside, and while Connor and Connor had a lively discussion going on, I was sitting kind of to their backs as I had to take a call. However, traffic was too loud, so I had to go around the corner.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned, I immediately noticed how my bag (with my computer and old passport), which was on the table, was gone. Not only that, but my cheese cake as well! Fast forward through the general yada yada of getting your things stolen (you panic, your look around suspecting everyone, you ask anyone whether they have seen anything), I surprisingly reached the acceptance stage fairly quickly. Connor and Connor felt pretty bad, but it was ultimately my fault for not telling them I would be gone. Megan, who was working the store that day, said she'd saw the person she suspected taking the bag, as she was behaving rather weirdly when she must have come in the seconds prior. She called the police and was generally incredibly accomodating. She even asked whether I wanted to take another cheese cake!\r\n\r\nKnowing that I'd probably not get my bag back and accepting that being mad doesn't do me any good (such a good stoic, much surprise), I decided that we should just meet our friend regardless. Megan suggested to leave my phone number in case the police were to come.\r\n\r\nAfter we met up with our friends and had some beers, I checked my phone and got the following voice mail:\r\n\r\n\u003ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"250\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/178511147\u0026amp;auto_play=false\u0026amp;hide_related=false\u0026amp;show_comments=true\u0026amp;show_user=true\u0026amp;show_reposts=false\u0026amp;visual=true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n\r\nI freaked out, she had the bag!!!

Lo and behold, she had my bag. Apparently, the lady who took my bag just wandered around, but walked by the shop again while Megan was on her lunch break. In her awesomeness, she ran after the lady, confronted her and got my bag back! And she still offered me cheese cake!!!

Read about some thoughts while they are fresh","tags":["Personal"],"created_at":"2014-06-02T03:28:33.757Z","body":"Two weeks ago, my family came over for my graduation in Boston. I was really excited to show them why I have come to love America and what it stands for. Obviously I can't quite replicate the college experience, though the sight of my parents at a frat party would most certainly be amusing. Instead, I was able to show them a little mix of New England suburbia and big metropolis like NYC and DC.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks was the perfect amount of time as my family started to wear down towards the end and so did I. Three days ago, they got on their flight out of DC while I was trying to figure out how to get back to Boston. Since I lost my ability to plan things ahead and am still dirt-cheap, flying was out. Thus I opted to take the 10h Megabus ride next morning, crashing with my friend in Maryland.\r\n\r\nWaking up the next morning, sure of that I would take the bus, one of my automated scripts sends me a notification of a $168 fare from NYC to Liberia, Costa Rica. And so the debate was on: Should I stay or should I go?\r\n\r\nAfter some short amount of deliberating with my friends, too many things prevented them from pulling the trigger: It's too short notice, others already had things or work to do, it is rainy season, it was simply to crazy to actually do.\r\n\r\nBut for me, it seemed like exactly what I wanted to do, I have always said that I want to try to live the location-independent lifestyle and a cheap fare to some exotic country right after graduation is the perfect way to try. Realistically, the worst thing that can happen is that I have spent a couple hundred dollars (which I expect to recover soon by actually working). The possible upside was to figure my life out. Hence, I pulled the trigger. My flight out of NYC would leave the next day.\r\n\r\nThe fare involved an overnight layover in Miami, which is the 5th worst airport to sleep in according to [sleepinginairports.net](http://sleepinginairports.net). So while I was trying to get some sleep, my brain does, what it usually does when I'm alone doing something that everyone else seems to think I'm crazy for: cognitive dissonance.\r\n\r\nI kept thinking of reasons of why this was a bad idea (which was very similar to the [situation in February](http://nambrot.com/posts/11-finding-your-passion-an-update/) when I took nearly two weeks of from school to go home): I don't have any proper clothes, no bathing suit, no shorts, but three pairs of shoes I bought in NYC. When I packed in Boston, I didn't do it with the expectation of leaving the country. I didn't had all my required documents with me. I wasn't a hundred percent sure I could actually enter the country (which proved to be a problem indeed). Can I return to the US? I haven't researched the area and barely booked a hostel. I don't speak a single word of Spanish. I was already developing a cold. Should I have vaccinations? Should I have gotten insurance?\r\n\r\nI have travelled my fair share, but I don't ever recall being that anxious about travelling. I realized that it was indeed somewhat spontaneous to hop on this fare. In situations like these, self-doubts arise: Do I try to be a more spontaneous person than I actually am, do I try to be someone that I am not? There are a lot principles or frameworks that I believe are part of my personal philosophy, but are they really mine, or do I like the idea of them being mine? \"Getting out of your comfort zone\" and \"Break things and fail fast\" sound like great mantras until you actually do it. Or maybe it was just that MIA was so god damn uncomfortable to sleep in.\r\n\r\nAnyways, there was no going back. The flight to Costa Rica itself was uneventful and after some hiccups at immigration, here I was. And let me tell you, the exact same thing happened like in February: I had a huge goofy smile on my face. I knew I made the right decision.\r\n\r\nNow, I know that there is a chance that this is an instance of counterfactual thinking, but that notwithstanding, it was great. The hostel I'm staying at is amazing, not even 10m from the beach, the weather is humid and hot, but not unbearable, it's actually perfect at night. Despite rainy season, it hasn't rained yet, and the sunset is beautiful. The ocean has perfect temperature and food is cheap. I can't speak Spanish, but human interaction always works. I also already got fooled out of $4 by a young boy and I wasn't even mad. The beach town Playa del Coco got together for a small festival on the boardwalk. I can hear the ocean at night. Pura Vida. All this with a $168 fare.\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing I learned from my recent travels is that things generally have a way of working out. I'm definitely not using my time most optimally. I don't really have a rain coat or hiking shoes which would make hiking the rainforest, volcanos and waterfalls even more adventurous, and diving costs quite a lot of money. But with the Pareto principle, being here already is 80% of the fun. Everything else is added bonus.\r\n\r\nChallenging yourself is always tough and I wouldn't go as far as to say that it's always beneficial, but arguably, pushing your own boundaries and comfort zone has generally been a great framework to live by, at least for me. I can only recommend it and wish more people would do it. If you have the option between default and something else, opt for the something else from time to time."},{"id":8,"title":"Strength of Paternalistic Arguments","summary":"A repost from my final paper for my 'Introdution to Ethics' class.","tags":["Philosophy"],"created_at":"2014-02-26T15:11:34.725Z","body":"A pervasive theme throughout the topics of the class was the idea of the value of life and how individuals and society should potentially value, judge and affect individual options and choices. Oftentimes, a significant factor in many of these discussions is the question of paternalism: Whether individuals can be wrong in their decisions of their own good and whether it is societies’ right or even duty to “correct” such wrongness, potentially by restricting the individuals’ freedoms. Most people agree on paternalistic arguments for various issues, such as slavery or child labor, while greatly disagreeing on other issues, such as drug use or euthanasia. But what determines the strength or validity of paternalistic arguments? While most authors we read evaluated paternalistic arguments based on a calculus of the harm prevented versus freedom restricted from a utilitarian perspective, I’d like to use the concept of insurance policies to focus on the probabilistic aspects of paternalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn “Paternalism,” Gerald Dworkin dissects arguments regarding paternalism in very great detail. Going forward, it is important to note that Dworkin isolates the paternalistic argument from other potential justifications of positions that may seem paternalistic. In particular, “pure” paternalism concerns only the restriction of an individual’s freedom when the potential harm is done to the individual itself, while other cases “can always be justified on non-paternalistic grounds, i.e. in terms of preventing harm to others” (Dworkin 244). We should also exclude “slippery-slope” arguments in which individual choices collectively result in harming others (e.g. unionization).\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy discussion of John Stuart Mill’s argument of “liberty above everything,” which dismisses most justifications of paternalism, Dworkin successfully generalizes Mill’s one exception for paternalistic intervention (on the grounds of preservation of future liberty) toward the general framework through which we shall evaluate paternalistic arguments: “Future-oriented consent” (248). Paternalism derives its validity solely from its ultimate advancement of the individual’s choices and values. Once again, it is crucial to note that we do not consider preventing individuals from harming themselves because we consider it a bad decision, but because we believe that in some future, the individual, assuming full moral rationality, will realize it is a bad decision (and presumably be thankful). When intervening, the paternalist has to, with the burden of proof, strongly believe that he is able to truly act according to the individual’s preferences and values and fully consider the severity of the bad decision (like irrevocability of liberty).\r\n\r\n\r\nDworkin very briefly and tangentially mentions a nonetheless very interesting analogy that helps us evaluate the strength of paternalistic intervention: Paternalism as an insurance policy protects us against the potentially catastrophic downside of making a truly bad decision for the recurring cost of restricted freedom (250). Consistently, factors that determine a good insurance policy should induce good paternalistic intervention. A good insurance policy has the lowest possible premium (in restricted freedom) for the highest possible claim value (of severity of harm prevented), but most importantly, is personalized towards one’s risk profile (the chance of the individual making a regrettable decision). There simply is no single best insurance policy for everyone. Furthermore, we have to point out one important distinction Dworkin’s analogy suffers from: The insurer (society) has little incentive to collect the premium and actually forces the claim upon the insured (the individual) as part of the contract. Hence, the difficulty of quantifying the chance of a regrettable decision becomes further complicated with the need for insured’s confidence or trust in the insurer to reliably predict the regrettable decision. \r\n\r\n\r\nConsider the discussion of paternalistic arguments in the case of suicide: Paternalistic interventions are heavily dependent on the chance of individuals choosing to commit a suicide they would (hypothetically) regret as well as on our (society's) ability to correctly gauge the individual’s moral agency specifically in such cases. When we consider it permissible for a parent to intervene his child or a mental facility intervene its depressive patient, what we are really saying is that we have strong confidence in them and their experience to reliably detect possible regret. Conversely, a strong paternalistic argument assumes that society respects the death wish of the terminally ill if it is truly according to their utilitarian preferences. Consequently, our relatively strong agreement on the perception of moral agency in cases of depression or terminal illness and how it relates to empirical evidence, as well as the relative experience by the paternalist supports the strength of the paternalistic argument in this case, not necessarily the (ultimate) severity of the downside.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrespondingly, the strength of the paternalistic argument in the case of drug use is weakened by the great lack of consensus on society’s ability to detect individuals’ making a regrettable decision when using drugs. Flat out prohibition ignores probabilistic factors of moral agency or addictiveness of many drugs, which seems to be overreaching and a poor indicator of predicting regrettable decisions. Opposition to the relatively high drinking age in the United States is equally cemented in the associated low trust in the lawmakers who overestimate their confidence in detecting individuals’ regret, especially considering its high prevalence and importance in common culture. That trust is further corroded by hypocrisy as evidenced in the fact that the last three US presidents admitted to cannabis consumption [1]. A more sensible policy based on paternalistic principles would be active education and discouragement, but the opportunity for mature individuals to responsibly consume drugs by providing sensible regulation and rehabilitation services when (possible) regret is much clearer. Once again, relativity in experience between the paternalist and the individual is what regulates the strength of the argument. For example, it is stronger when concerns prohibiting drugs to children, but not to presumably fully mature moral agents.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, by exemplifying the use of the insurance policy analogy as a way to evaluate paternalism in the cases of euthanasia and drug use, I have been able to show that our individual risk profiles and trust in the paternalist largely account for the validity of paternalistic arguments. You cannot evaluate utility decisions involving false-positives without probabilistic analysis, as evidenced in the case of paternalism. Many philosophical discussions assume full moral rationality, but we know empirically that this is not appropriate in reality. Hence, the strength is ultimately decided by our personal view of robustness of moral agency and human rationality in moral edge cases. That difference in risk profiles is largely explained by psychological disparities: insecure, undisciplined, regretful, self-conscious, trusting people are more likely; confident, self-righteous, narcissistic and paranoid people less likely to support paternalistic policy. Empirically, society’s tendency toward more individualism and individual responsibility will naturally reduce the strength of paternalistic arguments, as evidenced by the decline of paternalistic policies around the world, such as the liberalization of euthanasia, as well as the marijuana legalization efforts by many governments. \r\nBeyond the scope of this paper, we could continue extending the insurance policy analogy: When can/have to choose our insurance policy (society) according to our risk profiles? Do we actively sign it or is it implied?  Since there seems to be a baseline of cases in which most people, if not all, support paternalistic intervention (remember slavery), is there such thing as a minimum required insurance policy that everyone should be protected under? Can a society offer more than one insurance policy? What if our risk profile is too inconsistent with our societies’ predominant insurance policy?.\r\nUltimately, the insurance policy analogy highlights the frequently overlooked probabilistic aspects of any cost-benefit calculation and can hence help us evaluate utilitarian discussions more comprehensively by improving our often poor understanding of quantitative arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_politicians_who_admit_to_cannabis_use\r\n"},{"id":11,"title":"Finding Your Passion: An Update","summary":"It's been a while since my[ last post on the topic](http://nambrot.com/posts/5-finding-your-passion-is-supposed-to-be-easy/), so I figured I give some sort of status update.

While things are not 100% set and obvious yet, I feel a sense of clarity and comfort that I haven't felt in a while. I'd like to share what led to this.\r\n\r\nCollege and especially my vow to enjoy my last year in its fullest have definitely been a major contributing factor for my well-being. I have gained a lot from focusing on enjoying life now rather than later and avoided unnecessarily worrying by disregarding the supposedly harsh real life after college. Instead, I'm taking diverse classes in philosophy, psychology, arts, etc., playing on 8 intramural teams and just generally doing whatever I want.\r\n\r\nHowever, the biggest inflection point has been on my trip home to Germany in February, when I snagged an error fare from NYC to Milan for $240 round trip. Without going into unnecessary detail, something happened that jeopardized the whole trip that included a magnificent train ride through the Alps (besides obviously haven't seeing my family and friends in months). The rational/popular thing would have been to just cancel the trip, especially since people thought I was stupid enough for taking off 2 weeks of school.\r\n\r\nHowever, I decided to still go which was not an easy decision to make. Only moments later I got a snapchat questioning my decision which wasn't really helpful either. But the moment I sat on the train from Tirano to Ospizio de Bernina surrounded by 10+ feet of snow, I knew I did the right thing. There wasn't a place elsewhere in the world I'd rather be right now and let me tell you, that feeling is priceless.\r\n\r\nIt was this moment, that I found what I have been looking for all along. It wasn't some calling, it wasn't some special view on life, it was simply about being confident in yourself, your choices and knowing what you want.\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn my\u0026nbsp;[last post](http://nambrot.com/posts/5-finding-your-passion-is-supposed-to-be-easy/)\u0026nbsp;I attributed my anxiety to a paralysis of choice. In hindsight, I always had an idea of what my choice would ultimately be and the cause was not necessarily (only) the diversity of choice, but also the difference to the mainstream choice that made it so difficult. I think I knew the life I wanted to have, but being sure about it was very hard, especially if anything you want to do does not fit the mainstream narrative of happiness and success and the means of achieving such.\r\n\r\nOver the years, I've found that the best advice is the worst/hardest to follow. This is one is about ignoring what the world thinks of you, listening to your heart, surrounding yourself with people who accept you the way you are and doing what you want to do. I know this sounds like your typical teenage girl inspiration board. But it's true.\r\n\r\nI've had this habit of being jealous of people who would be better than me at a particular thing. I would eventually always meet a better soccer player, a smarter chemist, a more productive coder, a more awesome traveler. There were always people who were cooler, richer, more popular, more attractive, etc. Something about their life just seemed better. However, once I realized that I would never ever want to be them, none of that stuff mattered. I'm not someone who is the best at one thing, I'm great at a number of things, that's who I am. What has helped a lot to reach my \"enlightenment\" is to know that you wouldn't want to be anyone else, you wouldn't want to have it any other way.\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy passion is not some career goal or change in the world, some level of success or popularity, some activity I want to do for the rest of my life. It's not about results or achievements, it's all about the journey. It's about a set of true values and principles I want to live by. It's about doing things I want to do, and not doing things I don't want to do. Opting for new experiences. Ignoring beliefs/opinions that I can't do something. Living now and not in the some hypothetical future. Achieving myself and not my life. No excuses.\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy passion is to live my life to its fullest. And right now, my life is pretty awesome (for which I'm suuuuuppperrr thankful but that's the topic for another post).\r\n\r\n"},{"id":14,"title":"Credport Technical Post-mortem","summary":"This is a companion post to our [Tale of Credport post](http://nambrot.com/posts/13-the-tale-of-credport/) in which I will go into further detail about the technical problems we had and decisions we made.

You probably want to read that one before this one. Credport’s evolution in technical design on both the front-end and the back-end effectively coincided with our evolution from Boston/Webcred to Berlin/Credport.\r\n\r\n## Backend - All of the Data!\r\n\r\nI fondly remember the first days of the summer. I just came back from Germany and we just got introduced to the luxury of a well-run Highland Capital Office. Samir was still in town, so quickly we got the task of writing a production-worthy system. While we have extensively talked about how we envisioned Webcred and a rough prototype to learn from, we wanted to start from 0, truly brainstorming the requirements we had for our MVP.\r\n\r\nMuch of our initial efforts can be attributed to streamlining existing information from social networks and other sources, figuring out an efficient way to store and query such information, as well as ultimately design an API that would allow our partners to consume as well as contribute to our data.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the main post, we doubled down on Neo4j, as we saw common connection queries to be our competitive advantage. Maybe a bit too hastily, we assumed that meant that all of our data were to fit into Neo4j, as we expected managing both a relational DB and Neo4j to be too much complexity overhead (a decision we ultimately made with Credport). Thus the task of data normalization merged with the task of fitting it into a graph structure. After some time, we settled on the following schema:\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/wMpFljB.png)\r\n\r\nAt the heart of this schema is the User. It has simple key-value attributes such as names, as well as more complex attributes such as work places via a “works” edge to semantic job title/work nodes. Furthermore, the graph represents the identities the user holds on various social networks via what we called TpSubidentities, that may or may not be connected via email nodes. Connections between identities and other identities/entities were modeled with a Hypergraph approach by using a dedicated Connection node, which connects to the two objects via “halfedges” (to accommodate asymmetry) as well as a context-node describing the kind of connection (think “facebook-like” or “twitter-follow”).\r\n\r\nWhile it has certainly not been the most practical, the reasoning for it was as follows:\r\n\r\n### Expressiveness\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the primary goal was data normalization across networks, and I believe this schema definitely fits that. Not only can this schema fit Facebook’s, Twitter’s and LinkedIn’s schema (which were our primary data sources), but any arbitrary representation of identities and their connections to any other identities and entities. In that sense, it took a page from the OpenGraph playbook which does things similarly. That expressiveness also allowed us to design a flexible API that would enable anyone to display the user’s profile without having to know any network’s specific schema (an issue you don’t have with Facebook, as third-party OpenGraph data is not consumable by other third parties). In my mind, that was the most exciting part, as I saw every social networks’ data intertwine with perfect harmony. We could add a social network and any of our partners would be able to immediate display that data. Oh, the irony of thinking we could design the penultimate schema.\r\n\r\n### Common queries\r\n\r\nWith the graph being as semantic as possible, queries showing common connections to identities/entities, common workplaces/schools, even common majors were a non-brainer with this schema.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, only after quite some time did we see the pitfalls of this approach. The biggest issue was that we had data in the graph, that just didn’t feel right in the graph instead of a relational DB. I think our original desire to fit everything in the graph to avoid the complexity of managing two databases made us blind to the problem of over-normalization. Not everything belongs in the graph and I think we did a better job with the second iteration.\r\n\r\nAnother issue of using Neo4j exclusively was that we had to effectively built our own ORM over the REST-API. While we unfortunately lost our git history on that one, it involved writing an ActiveModel compliant API, figure out UUID generation and other stuff. Not so fun. Ultimately, we ended up with just too much time spent on managing complexity and technically debt early on, which wasted a lot of critical time in the summer.\r\n\r\nWith these learnings in mind, we decided to overhaul to a second-generation schema with Credport. That schema was much simpler and so straightforward, that I won’t go into too much detail. We would store all data in Postgres, only persisting a copy of identity and connection data with their ids in Neo4j. Our common connection query would find the appropriate nodes, return the ids and instantiate their appropriate ActiveRecord objects from Postgres. Managing two databases was a lot less stressful than we expected, and although we clearly had the issue of  having to roundtrip to two databases, Rails great caching infrastructure allowed us to still have great response times for our API, since profiles stay relatively static.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the evolution has been around simplifying the schema, we did end up adding what we called connection-context protocols. We preserved the context idea from our previous schema as third-party interoperability was still a priority for us. (Remember, a context gives developers everything they need to understand and appropriately display associated connections) However, we ran across the problem of contexts having similar traits such as reviews from different\r\nwebsites always containing text. Thus we came up with connection-context-protocols which act like validators of certain properties of the connection for connection-contexts which implement them. A bit over engineered again, but useful as we actually had API consumers this time around. Both Tamyca and Kinderfee had their own connection-contexts which implemented the text-protocol.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Frontend - Make the User Trustworthy\r\n\r\nWhile the backend was mostly about storing and querying our data in an appropriate way, the fronted problem was all revolved around one question: How do we make the user and his profile trustworthy? Assuming the user granted us data to their information, what was the best way to display it?\r\n\r\nAfter some deliberation, we distilled the trust problem into the following principles:\r\n\r\n- **The gut:** The first impression. The feeling of seeing someone for just a split second and forming a preliminary opinion about it. Incredibly strong and usually a good heuristic developed over generations of human interaction.\r\n- **The brain:** Analytical mode, where we try to rationalize our opinion, find objective measures of why we should trust a person. We usually return here when we get doubts.\r\n\r\nAny good frontend design would have to account for these two aspects of trust-building instincts. We derived them specifically to counter the concept of an in-transparent score. We disliked the idea of being told to trust someone, we just didn’t believe that this is how trust online works.\r\n\r\nAs you can maybe see from my history at Apture, or my recent redesign of my about page, I’m a huge fan of contextual depth: Keep things simple, but show more when appropriate. This is especially useful in our case, as the data we need to show to satisfy the gut is different from  the brain. Our working thesis was to make the profile easily glancable and trustable, but allow the viewer of a profile to dig deeper and find out why they should trust the profile.\r\n\r\nThis is what we ultimately created:\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/A9EHvxf.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the gut, we had a clean and simple design, less chrome and more content with a grid-ish structure for easy digestion. A profile pictures, customizable background picture and tagline give it a personal touch. On the top, you can see a quick quantitative summary as well as a list of verifications on the left. We used the LiveTiles box structure because we needed to let the user know what sections were available above the fold, while still be able to show content representative of that section. The rotation of the content as well as hover animations gave a sense of more information to allow the brain to inquire more. \r\n\r\nHere's the badge that marketplaces could embed:\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/VNZhhjV.png)\r\n\r\nWe had a lot less space obviously, but I think we made the most of it.

It was easy to quick to create (at the height, we imported data from7 sources, all with user consent only) and extensible by marketplaces with real transaction data. Unfortunately, only later we come to realize that it didn’t matter. To quote our email to advisors: “Trust is a problem that people often talk about, but don't really act upon.” (Just look at Craigslist)\r\n\r\nThat being said, we had an awful amount of fun with stretches of pain along the way, and clearly learned a lot, so we hope whatever we do next is gonna be half as interesting.\r\n\r\nP.S: With much delay, we are happy to be able to finally open-source our source code for Credport.

Arguably, I have done many things right in my past. I've had the luxury of attending college in the US, starting a great company with my roommate and travelling 35,000+ miles in the last 4 months alone. Along the way, I have met driven and passionate people, top notch in their respective fields, seen amazing places and made invaluable and diverse experiences. And I'm only 22.\r\n\r\nBy and large, I am near the top. I should be satisfied. I couldn't have possibly asked for more as I'm already stretching my luck. Succinctly, this was a comment on Facebook by a very good friend of mine earlier this month:\r\n\r\n\u003e I want your life. You're not allowed to complain about anything, ever.\r\n\r\nI'm here to say: Sorry to disappoint, Alex, but it has been a while since I have felt so lost. There, I have said it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, I have had amazing people to talk to who were giving me great advice. I wanted to take this opportunity to illustrate the journey of what it’s like to get doubts. Maybe someone will read this who is going through the same in the future.\r\n\r\n## Something just didn't feel right\r\n\r\n\u003e I liken my experience of leaving Google to breaking up with my college boyfriend. He was brilliant, good looking, respected, and everyone loved him — I even loved him — but he wasn’t the one.\r\n\r\n- Ellen Huerta - Why I left Google [1]\r\n\r\n\u003e If you haven't found it yet, keep looking, and don't settle, as with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.\r\n\r\n- Steve Jobs - Stanford 2005 Commencement Address [2]\r\n\r\nFor the first time I ever, I felt like I wasn't where I'm supposed to be. Like quoted above, it was something from within. An inner voice telling you that something was wrong. For the longest time, I have tried to suppress that voice. I told myself I just wasn't trying hard enough and not being appreciative of what I had. Having doubts is for the weak. What was happening?\r\n\r\n## With Choice comes Responsibility\r\n\r\nAt the root of the problem was a mixture of two things: 1. Paralysis of choice and 2. External Expectations. \r\n\r\nIt is my theory, that paralysis of choice is the greatest when making the jump from [Maslow's need](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow_pyramid) for safety to the need for esteem (I think love is more basic than safety). It's a truly liberating feeling in a time of seemingly perpetual economic crisis. When people stress out about their careers. When you realize that you are not confined to these restrictions. When anything is possible. When commitment is not required anymore. What do you do?\r\n\r\nFact is that with great choice comes paralysis, the difficulty and delay to choose. In this paralysis of choice, external factors can serve as seemingly great tie breakers: Just go with what everyone else would be doing. On way too many occasions, I have literally asked dozens of friends and strangers: \"What would you do if you could do anything?\"\r\n\r\nYou could get lucky and you get to your true calling, or you could realize that it most certainly isn't it. But most likely, you will find something in the middle (I barely ever speak in absolutes). Surely, that does not make things easier.\r\n\r\n## I'll have what he is having\r\n\r\nSo I had this paralysis of choice, which by itself is a problem indeed, but nothing that isn’t [widely known](What would you do if you could do anything?). However, combine that with increasing external expectation, and you got yourself a mess. \r\n\r\n\u003e When I sat down and really thought about why I was resisting, I realized something about myself that I didn’t like, something that I’m ashamed to even admit now. The main reason I was resisting was because I would be giving up the safety and prestige associated with life as a Googler. When I reflected more, I realized that external recognition had unfortunately become a primary motivator for me.\r\n\r\nThe social human beings that we are, we care a lot about what others think. That's neither surprising nor a flaw. However, the higher up you go the “external recognition” ladder, the more you and society are telling yourself that your other problems aren’t real. Having doubts is such a non-problem, a true #firstworldproblem, which makes it so much worse. When your life is externally going great, it gets harder to admit that something is wrong.\r\n\r\nHere is an exemplary and rather resentful comment on Ellen's piece:\r\n\r\n\u003e When you frame your process [of leaving Google] as a courageous struggle, you're not only being narcissistic, you're being rude and disrespectful to people who are really struggling, which﻿ is pretty much everyone else.\r\n\r\n- Ellen Huerta - Why I left Google [1]\r\n\r\nYou start to feel guilty for the way you feel It can’t possibly be a paralysis of choice, you are just being a coward, not focused enough, not appreciative enough. You'll end up blaming yourself.\r\n\r\n## Pseudo-Freedom and Dogma\r\n\r\nI think this is especially true in the startup world (probably the same in finance from what I’ve heard). Obscurely, people pride themselves for personal misery, long work hours are glorified like nowhere else. You having emotional issues simply means that you are not cut for an entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nWhat’s left is an incredible paradox for people: In our post-modern western fantasy world, we are obsessed with having the freedom to individualism and self-actualization. So obsessed that we actually get more self-conscious about external recognition as a quantification of our progress in achieving such freedom. Once our inner voice clash with these external influences, confusion is left. More often than not, we give into external pressure for the fear of being alone, of being truly different.\r\n\r\n\u003e Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to hide to believe that because I wasn't being trapped by the dogma of career, I wasn't trapped by dogma at all when in fact I was. And that realization made me afraid of what would happen once I took the courage to step out of that dogma.\r\n\r\n## On my way out\r\n\r\nI liked to tell myself that I'm not afraid. And its true. I’m not afraid that I won’t find a job. I think when a lot of people think about leaving their job, they are not afraid that they won’t be able to find another job. They are not afraid that they won’t be able to sustain their lifestyle. \r\n\r\nThe biggest fear when making a change out of a feeling of incompleteness is that doing so won't change a thing, that it will be worthless. That it won't fill the void they are feeling. That there is a possibility that you might have to live with this feeling for the rest of your life. That you have failed “at life”.\r\n\r\n## How to address fear\r\n\r\nWe have a multitude of fears at hand in situations like mine:\r\n\r\n1. Fear of regret to make the wrong decision.\r\n2. Fear of being different and going your own way.\r\n3. Fear of failing “at life”.\r\n\r\nLuckily, there are textbook solutions to address all these fears. \r\n\r\n1. Decide and don’t look back\r\n2. Just be yourself.\r\n3. Fail fast and early.\r\n\r\nLike so much of the best advice out there: Incredibly obvious, yet so hard to follow. You just gotta do it. You gotta stop listen to everyone else. Embrace failure. The only way to clear the fear is to stop being afraid. The worst thing you can do is to be intimidated by it. \r\n\r\n## Going forward\r\n\r\nFor as long as I can remember, I always knew what I wanted to do. I always had something I was passionate about. Once I lost interest, the next thing was usually just right around the corner.  I was a total chemistry geek when the iPhone came out to prompt me to program. I had an awesome time being irresponsible and having fun when a link to the Thiel Fellowship popped up on my Facebook feed. Things always had a way of working out. \r\n\r\nHowever that's looking backwards. In hindsight, I had the great luxury of decisions being magically made and fall right onto my lap just in time. Unfortunately, things don't always just happen and that's a first for me. There will be times where you won't know what to do. Your patience will be tested.\r\n\r\n\u003e You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart ...\r\n\r\nI for one, am grateful to have made those learnings on my path to “recovery”. I have a increased trust and belief in myself that feels incredibly refreshing. I’m gonna figure it out.

[Finding Cheap Flights - Search Tools](http://www.nambrot.com/posts/21-finding-cheap-flights-search-tools/)\r\n\r\nWhatever people are willing to pay for, Airlines try to extract as much revenue from that as possible. One way to do it is to account for variable demand by place of booking, departure and arrival. Let’s see how you can reduce your airfare by optimizing all three:\r\n\r\n### Place of Booking\r\n\r\nThe price of a ticket can be substantially affected by where you buy your ticket. The same ticket on the same flights can vary by as much as $200 depending on where the travel agency is ticketing. Surprisingly, OTAs in less developed countries tend to charge higher prices, presumably because air travel is restricted to the wealthy. One way I usually check for that is to search on Kayak.com, but then quickly replace the search URL with different domains such as .de, .it, .fr to see whether there is a substantial difference. I usually see at least $10-$20 difference. This however only works if you have a debit/credit card that doesn’t charge a foreign transaction fee.\r\n\r\n### Place of Departure/Arrival\r\n\r\nSome airports are cheaper to depart of than others. I live in New York, which generally has the lowest international tickets in the region. So when I was living in Boston, more than once I would take the bus down to New York to take advantage of that price difference. Note that you will have to consider the added cost in terms of time and transportation/accommodation cost when you don’t have/don’t want to crash with a friend. I also did this when departing from Berlin, which rarely has cheap flights (due to higher airport taxes in Germany and other reasons). If you feel like visiting other places, you can take a bus/train or even flight to cheaper departure spots like Warsaw or Milan. I consider it two killing two flies with one stone: you get to fly cheaper while seeing another city.\r\n\r\n**LCCs**\r\n\r\nThus, you can save substantial amounts by picking a different destination nearby.  Many regions have an extensive network of Low Cost Carriers (LCCs like Ryanair, Air Asia, etc.) that make it very convenient to hop from one place to another. Some countries have much higher airport taxes than others (Germany and GB e.g.), so avoid those if you can and maybe take a bus/train there.\r\n\r\n**Open Jaw Routings**\r\n\r\nOpen Jaws are routes where its not A - B / B - A, but A - B / B - C or A - B / C - A. Fare rules for these types of routings are sometimes very lenient and result in lower prices, as well as the added benefit of seeing another place.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Hidden city ticketing**\r\n\r\nSometimes, something very obscure can happen. Sometimes a flight with a layover in Airport A to reach Airport B can be cheaper than a direct flight to Airport A. Remember that airfare pricing has nothing to do with the actual cost to the airline, but everything with the willingness of the travelers to pay a certain price. Hidden city ticketing is the process of booking a ticket to Airport B via Airport A with the intention of never taking the flight from A to B. Caveat: You can not check a bag, since it will obviously make its way to Airport B, thus you should manically avoid being the last guy to board, because of the possibly to get your baggage gate-checked. Hidden city ticketing is against the terms and conditions of most carriers, thus you would have hard time explaining why you would need your baggage at the layover. Also note that with the miss of any flight, your following flights will automatically get cancelled as well, so this only works if you want to do this on the return leg or on a one-way ticket.\r\n\r\n**Special Sales Events**\r\n\r\nCertain routes are often times put in deal mode for various reasons. For example, the LCC Norwegian Air Shuttle is offering very competitive trans-atlantic flights, especially between Scandinavia and New York. As a result, legacy carriers across the board have made routes from Oslo, Copenhagen and others to the US very cheap. Cheap enough for me to take a flight to Oslo to take to the US instead of flying directly to the US. Last year, Emirates introduced their NYC-Milan route, causing the route to go cheap across many carriers.\r\n\r\n**Warning:**\r\n\r\nBy breaking up your itinerary onto multiple tickets, you lose your protection in case you are going to miss a flight because of a delay of a prior flight. The way I mitigate that is to stay at least a night between separate tickets, you’d probably wanna do it anyways if you want to actually see the city."},{"id":19,"title":"Finding Cheap Flights - When Time Matters","summary":"This article is about how airfare is influenced by date and time, both for the time of booking as well as the time of travel.","tags":["Travel"],"created_at":"2015-02-11T11:09:40.662Z","body":"\r\n1. [Finding Cheap Flights - Introduction](http://www.nambrot.com/posts/22-finding-cheap-flights-introduction/)\r\n2. Finding Cheap Flights - When Time Matters\r\n3.

[Finding Cheap Flights - Search Tools](http://www.nambrot.com/posts/21-finding-cheap-flights-search-tools/)\r\n\r\nThis article is about how airfare is influenced by date and time, both for the time of booking as well as the time of travel. First some unsurprising facts:\r\n\r\n- Airfare is dominated by plain supply and demand. \r\n- That means that flying during high season and holidays is more expensive. (Everyone wants to fly home during Thanksgiving or wants to take a vacation in the summer)\r\n- Booking late is more expensive than booking early\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also some other subtleties that many are not aware of. Did you ever wonder why booking a one-way ticket is usually more expensive than booking the same route as a round-trip? Ever felt angry that booking a last minute flight was ridiculously expensive, only to find the airline not being able to fill all the seats after takeoff? Why changing the date of your ticket costs so much? It all has to do with one thing: price discrimination.\r\n\r\nAs a wannabe-economist, price discrimination is one of the most fascinating phenomenon. It's pretty simple in the case of airfare: there are leisure travelers like you and me and business travelers. Business travelers have a lot of money so spend on airfare, leisure travels not so much. Airlines are a for-profit venture, so they want to make most of two the groups. If they price the tickets too low, they might be able to sell more tickets to leisure travels. However in this case, they would miss out on a lot of revenue with the business travelers who would be willing to pay a lot more and are more concerned with flexibility and comfort. Conversely, if they charge high prices, they get much more money from the business travelers but leave many seats empty because the leisure travels can't afford the price. So how do airlines solve this dilemma?\r\n\r\nThey obviously cannot \"openly\" discriminate and say leisure travelers pay $XX and business travelers pay $XXX (which would be the most economical and fair solution though). So the next best thing is to create different classes of tickets to incentivize leisure travelers to buy booking class A while business travelers buy booking class B. Let's see how this works out in reality:\r\n\r\n### 1) One-way is more expensive than Roundtrip\r\n\r\n\r\nLeisure travelers rarely have to fly from A to B one-way, while business travelers regularly do so. That's why airlines used it as a great discriminator by charging as much as tenfold for one-ways compared to road trips. Think about it: It's more profitable for an airline to charge 1 business traveler $1000 for a one-way then charge 1 business traveler and 4 leisure travelers $100. Theoretically, the common practice of just buying a round-trip and just not using the return leg is forbidden in the airlines terms of service and they are entitled to reprice the ticket accordingly. In reality however, airlines rarely do so.\r\n\r\n### 2) Booking late is more expensive than than booking early\r\n\r\n\r\nLeisure travels usually can/have to plan their travels long ahead, while business travelers usually do so on short notice. That's why booking class A (the cheaper one) is usually only available weeks/months in advance, while booking class B is bookable anytime.\r\n\r\n### 3) Wanting to Change/Cancel Flights is more expensive\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated to 2), leisure travelers rarely have to change or cancel their flights, whereas business travelers regularly do (schedule changes etc.) That's why booking class A has fees for changing/canceling flights whereas booking class B is more flexible with that.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 4) Red-eyes are cheaper than flights during the day\r\n\r\n\r\nBusiness travelers don't feel like taking red-eyes (flights overnight). Neither do leisure travelers, but they are willing to take them for lower prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 5) Saturday returns are cheaper than Same-day returns \r\n\r\n\r\nLeisure travelers usually travel for a week or more, while business travelers oftentimes are only gone for a day if at all. That's why many of the cheaper booking classes have the so-called saturday-return restriction, where you can only return after staying for a saturday night or prohibit same-day returns, i.e. arriving in the morning and leaving in the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 6) Flying Monday Mornings are more expensive than Tuesdays\r\n\r\n\r\nBusiness travelers have particular schedules that you can work around to get cheaper tickets. Monday mornings are usually rush hour for business travelers, the weekend is popular as well for both leisure and business travelers so try to avoid these times. Statistically, it's best to fly on Tuesdays.\r\n\r\n### 7) Booking Monday Morning is more expensive then Tuesdays\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, try to avoid popular times for booking your flight. Business travelers often do it in the mornings, especially Monday. Leisure travelers on the other side often book on the weekend. Once again, Tuesdays are best.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat being said, every rule has it's exception, so take these with a grain of salt. \r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"id":24,"title":"Semi-Nomadism - a way of life","summary":"In this post, I'm talking about the setup of my life after college. Warming: A bunch of generalizations and strong opinions","tags":["Travel","Personal"],"created_at":"2015-04-19T20:19:40.175Z","body":"Warming: A bunch of generalizations and strong opinions\r\n\r\nWhen I graduated college, I had the same question like any other senior: What the hell do I do after? I delayed it for a good while, but it’s inevitable like death. None of the traditional options particularly appealed to me when trying to optimize for several dimensions like fulfilling work, social life (friends, family and strangers), time/opportunity for hobbies, travel and financial gain. Thus, I took the nuts and bolts I liked and glued them together into what I call Semi-Nomadism which I have been practicing for the last 9 months. It might very well be a thing lots of people do, but I definitely haven’t seen it being talked about as a viable alternative for potentially many others.\r\n\r\n### What is Semi-nomadism?\r\n\r\nSemi-nomadism suggests to have a permanent home (conversely to full nomadism) while going on 4HWW-style mini-retirements to various destinations, ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months. While semi-nomadism encourages the reduction of unnecessary possessions by virtue of its relative frequent travel, it allows you to store more stuff in your home than your average nomad. \r\n\r\n### Vs. Full Nomadism:\r\n\r\nOne of my major gripes with full nomadism is what I perceived to be a potentially constant feeling of transition and lack of belonging. I liked the tight community and social life at college and I wasn’t ready to give it up completely. While semi-nomadism still has substantial remnants of those problems, having a home base to return to is greatly alleviating. Also, having a home base allows you to come into an office more frequently (or be more reliable with timezone overlap with your team mates for most of the time.) While you obviously need to be setup to do work remotely, being fully remote in my opinion is still a hindrance to company culture unless you are very vigilant about it. Semi-nomadism allows you to have more constancy in regards to your work environment and make you more of a “team-player”. Obviously, the downside is the need for a permanent home that is vacant for substantial amounts of time but Airbnb/Craigslist can alleviate that to an extent.\r\n\r\n### Vs. Traditional on-site full-time work:\r\n\r\nIn-office, full-time work especially at many companies invariably leads to a situation in which time spent in the office is valued. Presence is often taken as an indicator of commitment to a company. Some people say that office environments especially with open floor plans where distraction and small talk might reach counter productive levels. Since creative work is different from let’s say “manual” labor, you simply cannot schedule and sustain high productivity for longer time periods, thus it is completely natural to spend your time at work “not doing work”. This is a tough one for me, because I absolutely love love going to the office. As I work remotely for a good amount, it gets lonely very fast. You also get a level of crossover collaboration that is hard to come by when you are remote.\r\n\r\nSemi-nomadism by virtue of being remote for a significant part brings back the focus to the actual work you produce which is great if your productivity per time unit is high. This is a topic of much research, but I’m a strong opponent of working whenever you can get into the zone, whether that is 9AM or 9PM. When I’m not feeling productive, forcing myself to work does no one any good. Being flexible with work hours increases overall productivity which is great for the company and leaves me with a significant amount of free time I can spend on other things such as hobbies or travel.\r\n\r\n### Why Semi-nomadism now?\r\n\r\nI’d say historically, pulling semi-nomadism off might have been hard to pull off logistically and financially, but airfare prices are plummeting, language/cultural barriers are coming down, finding a place to stay for more than a week becomes easier and remote work more acceptable. In fact, I now spend the most money while at home in New York. I love being able to see many places and culture with a continuous sense of novelty, but not feel like a tourist that just checks off the sights in 3 days. I get to experience more closely what it would be like to live in a particular place. I still get to see family and friends on a frequent basis (although building new longer-term relationships is difficult). \r\n\r\nOverall, I strongly recommend this way of life for anyone interested in marrying more substantial travel experiences with meaningful, impactful work as a digital creative worker. Not only for it’s benefits, but also to learn what is important to you as you a mix of both, thus preventing you from romanticizing about the possibility of the other side. \r\n\r\nP.S.: A really great post on the topic how it's actually like as a nomad: [http://www.computerworld.com/article/2492064/mobile-wireless/what-it-s-really-like-to-be-a-digital-nomad.html](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2492064/mobile-wireless/what-it-s-really-like-to-be-a-digital-nomad.html)"},{"id":9,"title":"Find_each with custom ordering in Rails","summary":"In a recent project of mine I had to implement an activity feed.

[Finding Cheap Flights - Search Tools](http://www.nambrot.com/posts/21-finding-cheap-flights-search-tools/)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen people think of reasons not to travel, cost of travels is usually high up on the list. A big chunk of that cost is getting from A to B. This guide will help you to reduce that cost, so that there is no more excuse not to see the world. This is a culmination of things I have been writing for a while, but never been able to get out. There is hopefully much more to come.\r\n\r\nThe single best way to save on airfare is to be flexible. Can you only travel on specific dates or can you fly a day before or after? Can it be a day or two longer? Oftentimes, changing the travel dates by a day or two can save you hundreds of dollars. Check out [my post](http://www.nambrot.com/posts/19-finding-cheap-flights-when-time-matters/) on how your timing can influence the price you pay for your ticket.\r\n\r\nHowever, flexibility with travel and booking dates isn't the only way to save money. You can also save a significant amount by being flexible with your destination as well as how and when you get there. Just one example, this summer I wanted to fly to Vietnam, but flights from Berlin to Vietnam started at 800 Euros. However, at the same time, flying from Amsterdam to Bangkok was only 400 Euros. My train to Amsterdam is 30 Euros and my flight to Vietnam 150 Euros. So not only have I saved more than 200 Euros, but I also get to see two other amazing cities. Read more about stopover flexibility in [my post about when place matters](http://www.nambrot.com/posts/20-finding-cheap-flights-when-place-matters/).\r\n\r\nFor both, there are tools that can help you maximize your savings by incorporating the knowledge in the above tips. I present some in [this post](http://www.nambrot.com/posts/21-finding-cheap-flights-search-tools/).\r\n\r\nAll these posts cover fairly basic concepts. If you are interested in going even further, there are two additional things out there:\r\n\r\n**Credit Cards**: If you are based in the US, you should get on top of your credit. Credit card companies routinely offer very enticing sign up bonuses. Some people take it to the maximum with Manufactured Spend, the practice of artificial purchases for the sole reason getting points. [Read more here](http://thinkingonward.com/credit-card-churning-an-overview-and-instruction-guide/).\r\n\r\n**Fuel Dumping**: It’s kind of a dying art, but if you combine flights in a particular way, sometimes you can achieve a significant reduction in part of the airfare cost which is called the fuel surcharge. Experts in Fuel Dumping can travel the world consistently for below $200 dollars anywhere in the world. It used to be much easier to do, but public disclosures led to Airlines cracking down as well as more secrecy among experts. You can find a good introduction [here](http://travelcodex.com/2012/01/introduction-to-fuel-dumping/)."},{"id":21,"title":"Finding Cheap Flights - Search Tools","summary":"This post presents some tools you can use to put that knowledge you have learned into play to finally book your flight.\r\n","tags":["Travel"],"created_at":"2015-02-11T13:23:42.307Z","body":"\r\n1.

Finding Cheap Flights - Search Tools\r\n\r\nThis post presents some tools you can use to put that knowledge you have learned into play to finally book your flight.\r\n\r\nUnless you know where exactly you want to go, exploratory tools like  [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights/#search;f=JFK,EWR,LGA;d=2015-03-11;r=2015-03-18;mc=m)/[Kayak Explore](https://www.kayak.com/explore/) are a great way to start planning your itinerary. It is also helps you realize that the price of a ticket is not a pure function of distance travelled. Start by picking nearby airports and narrowing down your entry points to a region (this is really only applicable for 1-week+ international travel)\r\n\r\nThere are tons of blogs dedicated to finding cheap flights, so it’s often advisable to just check those whether you might be lucky with a particular sale etc. For US departures, [TheFlightDeal](http://www.theflightdeal.com/) has been the most reliable resource, for Europe departures, [HolidayPirates](http://www.holidaypirates.com/) and their local offsprings have a tremendous following.\r\n\r\nOnce you narrowed down your entry points or region, you want to plan your actual destinations on this trip and how to get around. For these cases, I usually use [Skypicker](https://www.skypicker.com) and [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.com). Skypicker will show you how to get to various destinations with a lot of place and time flexibility and can also search across tickets (like Ryanair, easyJet, etc.). For a given pair, Skyscanner usually finds the cheapest online travel agency through which to book. On Skyscanner, you can specify to search whole months at a time.\r\n\r\nIf you are feeling lazy, [GoEuro](http://www.goeuro.com/) and [Rome2Rio](https://rome2rio.com) are travel search engines which take into account multiple modes of transportation as well as ground transportation to find the best possible route between two points.\r\n"},{"id":23,"title":"Snappy server-rendered web app with Rails/Webpack/React/Flux","summary":"In this blog post, I show up to build a web application that combines the benefits of server-rendered HTML and client-side JS","tags":["Rails","Development"],"created_at":"2015-04-13T13:50:35.798Z","body":"There are two main tradeoff options web application developers have to think about today:\r\n\r\n### Interactivity\r\n\r\nFor most web applications in 2015 that have a non-trivial amount of interactivity, client-side rendering and routing becomes inevitable. While solutions like Turbolinks/pjax can work well for some (and are always preferable in those cases), many web applications exceed that abstraction and roundtrips to the server cost valuable time between interactions. If you want to get as close to a native experience as possible, client-side rendering (and client-side routing) is the way to go.\r\n\r\n### Time to first interaction\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the push for client-side rendering caused many web developers to disregard the amount of time until your web applications becomes usable after fetching/parsing/rendering. No one likes to stare at a blank screen for up to 5s before being able to do anything. For some apps this might be less critical (productivity apps a la Gmail, Google Docs come to mind), but for many web applications in 2015, this is a no-no. Twitter famously pushed back to server-side rendering when optimizing for their `time-to-tweet` metric. Another concern for some applications may be SEO which is also difficult to obtain with client-side rendered apps.\r\n\r\nOften times, these two objectives are seemingly at odds with each other, with the perception often being that you have to choose between either server-side or client-side rendering of your apps. Having the SEO and time-to-first-interaction benefits of server-side rendering combined with the performance and interactivity of client-side rendering is the \"holy grail\" but has historically come with a significant overhead in development, especially the sharing of UI templates on both the server and the client, as well as a comprehensive state management solution that works across that boundary. However, the web development community have made significant progress on that front, see for example [Airbnb's efforts](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/), [Ember FastBoot](http://tomdale.net/2015/02/youre-missing-the-point-of-server-side-rendered-javascript-apps/) or the many projects around isomorphic react/flux.\r\n\r\n### An Example\r\n\r\nHowever, as of right now, there has yet to be a good example/tutorial of how to write such \"holy grail\" web app with established tools and best practices. Which is why I created the following tutorial, whose code you can find at [https://github.com/nambrot/rails-webpack-react-flux](https://github.com/nambrot/rails-webpack-react-flux) and a demo instance running [http://rails-react.nambrot.com/](http://rails-react.nambrot.com/).\r\n\r\nIt's a very simple blog, yet offers the following features:\r\n\r\n- Fully server-rendered HTML, meaning you can actually use the application without JS enabled.\r\n- Minimization of unnecessary data fetching, as in embededing relevant data in the response as JSON and loading additional data if necessary\r\n- Once loaded, everything going forward is client-side rendered and cached, making it incredibly responsive.\r\n\r\nI used Rails as my favorite web framework and combined it with React and Flux on the client side via Webpack to render your UI on the server. I want to give credits to others you have tried to make React work with Rails, namely Justin Gordon's [Repo](https://github.com/justin808/react-webpack-rails-tutorial) and [Kevin Old](http://kevinold.com/2015/02/04/configure-webpack-dev-server-and-react-hot-loader-with-ruby-on-rails.html)\r\n\r\nMost Rails/React/Flux examples out there are usually lacking in two departments:\r\n\r\n1. They are \"just\" TodoMVC, i.e. don't concern themselves with persistence to a real server (e.g. with CRUD) by using localstorage.\r\n2. SSR examples with React usually only concern with spitting out HTML without addressing a data management strategy a la Flux. Most will return HTML but require a second rountrip to initialize the Stores. When they do, they usually load the whole collection in, which isn't so great.\r\n\r\nI'll try to keep this as concise as possible in a step-by-step guide of how I approached the topic. I'm starting with a very basic Rails Blog that we will gradually \"holy-grailify\". The following links all points to commits with hopefully helpful commit messages.\r\n\r\n### 1. Introducing Webpack and [NPM](https://github.com/nambrot/rails-webpack-react-flux/commit/bada647a36bdcd06250dcc6f48eae8e407ba2703)\r\n\r\nLove the asset pipeline to death, but the lack of true modules definitely gets noticable with larger amounts of client side code. We will be using [Webpack](https://github.com/nambrot/rails-webpack-react-flux/commit/2277952e562891e37872a29fff64f96ca3b1fd60) to allow us to write modular code as well as use the great diversity of the NPM ecosystem, with easy compilation for client-side assets as well as [hot-loading](https://github.com/nambrot/rails-webpack-react-flux/commit/2277952e562891e37872a29fff64f96ca3b1fd60)\r\n\r\n### 2. Setup basic React and Flux\r\n\r\nWe are going to set the barebones of the Flux architecture without thinking too much about the server part, for now, we will just fetch everything on demand. That includes setting up the basic App structure\r\n\r\n**[React-Router](https://github.com/nambrot/rails-webpack-react-flux/commit/c8052433cb8350a916bbe8fbc4decb81de0c0d03)**\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/nambrot/f93bd833f358a25c444f.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\n**[Flux with Flummox](https://github.com/nambrot/rails-webpack-react-flux/commit/715a1a4567775e7e818007ad017faf181194929f)**\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/nambrot/633a910a4ac7ed63ce52.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\n### 3. [Store Deserialization](https://github.com/nambrot/rails-webpack-react-flux/blob/2c1727554373fd1e147df7133442c16079efb3a3/app/assets/javascripts/stores/post.coffee)\r\n\r\nThe first step to server side rendering is to be able to deserialize data into the store for the client. This also avoids the inital request for data. React is also smart enough to not touch the DOM as the resulting HTML is identical.\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/nambrot/bb2b5aae8d1efe16adb7.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\n### 4. Add Server-Side Rendering\r\n\r\nWe are going to use a [simple express server](https://github.com/nambrot/rails-webpack-react-flux/commit/545326e280ee3e483866e7222315aa784b97feeb) which will take the 1. route and 2. serializedState as parameters and [simply return the HTML](https://github.com/nambrot/rails-webpack-react-flux/commit/02204f74006390a8cbb591eb2281aa22d38dd7c1). The result is complete HTML pages being returned. In fact, you should now be able to navigate the page without the need for Javascript enabled, time-to-render on the client is faster, obvious SEO benefits. The downside is a \"round-trip\" to the express server\r\n\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/nambrot/6db6304068ddbe3ce6dc.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\n###  Conclusion\r\n\r\nAs you can see, building the \"right\" web application is not trivial, there is still a lot of decisions and configuration to be made. While the benefits are great, the cost may not be justifiable for many apps and should be carefully considered with the above trade-offs. I for one am excited for Ember's FastBoot that seems to be the least amount of effort to get the benefits."},{"id":25,"title":"How I turned away from the digital nomad lifestyle","summary":"\r\nIt's been a while since I have blogged and a lot has changed.

As per usual, I've been learning a lot, thus been readjusting what the optimal lifestyle means to me. Some of those learnings I want to share here.\r\n\r\n### Relationships are hard, they require time\r\n\r\nNo matter what your lifestyle is, creating and maintaining relationships with friends and family, new and old, close and far is really difficult. While I thoroughly enjoyed being able to visit a bunch of my favorite people around the world in their various environments, my time in NYC, my home base, has been suffering. When you move to a new city, especially one like NYC, you can meet all kinds of cool people and do all kinds of cool stuff. However, when you are never there, it makes it really tough to make meaningful relationships with anyone. The best ingredient for good human connection is, and probably will always be, time. It didn't help that I wasn't working in an office, but remotely from home, which can make you go insane. I tried coworking spaces and coffeeshops, but it just didn't work me (presume again because of time). If you are going to go away, make sure that your home is truly a home.\r\n\r\n### Life is hard, it requires meaning\r\n\r\nWhile being all over the place, I had a lot of time for introspection. I was working 20 hours or less and did so in amazing places. I got to meet cool people and have unique experiences. Yet, I didn't feel satisfied. I think a lot of people can draw significant value from travel itself, but that didn't seem to work for me. Call it millenial brainwash, but I just didn't feel fulfilled in travelling this much. I didn't feel very useful or learning something useful (apart from all the big life stuff you know). While I tried really hard to avoid becoming focused on work over the last few years, maybe that's just who I am. At least it works for me (for now). I was lucky that I've been contracting for [Wellframe](http://www.wellframe.com) for a while. During that time, I've got to know the team as well as the problem they are trying to face. I totally fell for the mission of revolutionizing healthcare. That's why I have decided to move to Boston to join Wellframe fulltime.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Communication is hard, it requires skill and buy-in\r\n\r\nA major challenge and reason to go local and fulltime was the incredible difficulty to get work done remotely. While it obviously works for a lot of other people and other problem domains, it didn't work at least with Wellframe. We have a very multi-disciplinary company, not only within the engineering team between mobile app developers, data scientists and frontent engineers, we also have to cordinate tightly with our client-services, clinical and other co-workers. While I don't doubt that creating a highly collaborative, quickly moving, multi-displiciplinary enterprise health care company can be done in a distributable fashion, it requires dedication and buy-in as a primary cornerstone of the culture. Even now it's hard enough without the distributed nature.\r\n\r\nAll of the above learnings made me adjust the way I view nomadism. Given my current priority set, I'm significantly reducing my travel time. Of the time that I'm travelling, I'm focusing even more to spend it with the people I really care about. Looking forward to what I will change next time!\r\n"},{"id":26,"title":"Auto-generated API documentation","summary":"Let's face it, you are probably not documenting as much as you should.
